## Laws & All (JUL 2024)

Provided they're normal and not NFA (automatic, grenade, rocket launchers). As far as carrying them go, Michigan is unique in that they have the city of Detroit and all their gun laws are based around Detroit. Indiana & OH have permitless concealed cary. You can get a concealed carry and go a few extra places. But when you're walking back from the auto-shop the other day you can have it tucked under your shirt. Michigan doesn't have that because of CCW repricoity which Michigan is buttholes about it.&#x20;

If you are a resident in Ohio, you are licensed to conceal carry. If someone gets a permit in Indiana, it works in Ohio but not Michigan. Then there's things that are loaded or not or idk I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Loaded & cambered means something else.&#x20;

Take some classes in my area that'll answer my questions if I get something. Some are just laws. Some do shooting too. They'll help inform you and you can get hands on and learn about things. When you get pulled over, you start with your hands on the steering wheel & let them know there's a firearm with a loaded mag with an empty chamber in my glove box or "I have a concealed weapon on my person on my right hip or back or whatever". The officer will thank you for informing and stuff.&#x20;
