# Chautauqua Institute

This week, I'm staying at the Chautauqua Institute for a retreat. They have a school of music, plenty of lectures/live music, and a great community. The institute was built somewhat experimentally in the late 1800s, so entering it feels like you're traveling through time. Below are some miscellaneous bullets helpful for when I visit in future years.
