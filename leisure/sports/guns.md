# Gun Laws & Bears

Need something for hiking.

9mm and 45mm ACP.

"Cant go wrong with a glock". Grip angle, but it's a perfectly functional & reliable firearm." Asking $650 or $730 by the time you get it.&#x20;

Likes HK a lot.

## Taurus Judge (A Bad Recommendation)

Apparently, there's a gun that can kill bears (as it shoots shotgun shells), but is [otherwise mediocre](https://www.reddit.com/r/Firearms/comments/1bxm841/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_taurus_judge/). This was recommended to me as it could probably kill bears; however, some preliminary research on Googe says it's woefully inadequate for this purpose as:

1. Ammunition is not powerful enough. .410 shotgun shells are weak & don't have energy to penetrade a bear's thick hide and heavy bone to reach vital organs.
2. A .410 slug has low power coming from a pistol, less than a .45 Colt ammunition & won't penetrate on large/tough animals.
3. .45 colt ammos are supported w/ this gun, but too weak. You could get +P, high-pressure, bear loads but the Taurus Judge is not typically rated to handle htis.&#x20;

The real problem is a bear's stopping power.&#x20;

## Laws & All (JUL 2024)

Provided they're normal and not NFA (automatic, grenade, rocket launchers). As far as carrying them go, Michigan is unique in that they have the city of Detroit and all their gun laws are based around Detroit. Indiana & OH have permitless concealed cary. You can get a concealed carry and go a few extra places. But when you're walking back from the auto-shop the other day you can have it tucked under your shirt. Michigan doesn't have that because of CCW repricoity which Michigan is buttholes about it.&#x20;

If you are a resident in Ohio, you are licensed to conceal carry. If someone gets a permit in Indiana, it works in Ohio but not Michigan. Then there's things that are loaded or not or idk I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Loaded & cambered means something else.&#x20;

Take some classes in my area that'll answer my questions if I get something. Some are just laws. Some do shooting too. They'll help inform you and you can get hands on and learn about things. When you get pulled over, you start with your hands on the steering wheel & let them know there's a firearm with a loaded mag with an empty chamber in my glove box or "I have a concealed weapon on my person on my right hip or back or whatever". The officer will thank you for informing and stuff.&#x20;

## Sites

* Gunbroker will ship it to a gun store or someone with their FFL.
  * You got to them to pick it up and they do the background check.&#x20;

## Takeaways

* Big bullets/ammo are required for bears, and they're usually not legal for US consumers without special licensing for explosions and weapons manufacturers.&#x20;
* Remember - bear spray is a good tool too.
