## Taking it to the streets

First song in this video blows me away. The rhythm is awesome. There's some gently surprises with the rhythm. The piano sounds great and it's something that should be studied. I LOVE the piano fills. I love the saxaphone too. Incredible vocals. The whole song is just a party. It's got a nice Vulfpeck walking up in half-time.&#x20;

## Black Water

* SHAKER is played very well. It's the first time I really heard someone play the shaker very, very well. It's better than what I can do.
* HARMONIES with the vocals is something I'd love to copy/steal with that group. I almost want to analyze the vocal lines there because it's worth it.&#x20;
* FIDDLE: has a solo that's notable. It doesn't sound great. Actually, it sounds bad and there's high squeeks and he jams on one note for a while. But it fits in this.&#x20;
* Parts of it are just "mid". Simple. I won't say "bad", but it's nothing fancy but they make it sound very energetic even though it's a slow song.&#x20;
* DRUMS: also basic in this song. But it sounds great. Uses brushes a lot. Has a good sound that I thought you could only do on Logic. I feel like I could actually play this drump part though which is what I love about it. And I'm not a great drummer. I'm probably mid. But I could do this but the way it's orchestrated it's lovely.&#x20;
* SILENCE: there's some vocals or very limited musical accompanyment towards the end but it's still really, really good.
* Gives me James Ashenbauer (from Chromascape) vibes.

## Listen to the Music

* EIGHT BARS of rhythm isn't new, but they do a good job in the intro. Eveything centers around that in the intro.
  * Even the guitar just plays the same note?&#x20;
* HARMONIES: WHOA-WOO-WAHHHHs are just really, really good.&#x20;
  * FOURTHS: I normally hear harmonizing done in thirds. The fourths is interesting. Or maybe it's a 7th or a 9th? I'd have to listen longer/better than my scrapnotes.&#x20;
  * BREAK: have the audience sing the song all out-loud and clap?
