# Everly Brothers

My favorite band is the Beatles because they use a standard set of instruments until they moved outside the 12-tone instruments when traveling and I suspect during their psychadellic. Songs today I find are overly produced, minus some spectacular takes I see at Tiny Desk concerts where there are rules against using autotuners and software insturments.

Love, Love me Do is the first osng I heard, probably from my dad or my grandpa. And they have a few lessons:

* Sing in thirds from another singer.
* It helps if you're sibblings/brothers and have roughly the same type of voice. I would love to sing with my sister.
* Being overly romantic, yet wise, is always entertaining to listen to and you can talk a lot about love in your songs.

#### Personal Favorites

* All I Have to Do Is Dream



#### See Also - Other Incredible Vocals

* The Beatles: _This Boy (Takes 12 And 13), Happiness is a Warm Gun,_&#x20;
* The Beach Boys: _don't worry baby._
