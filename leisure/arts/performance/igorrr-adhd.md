IGORRR - ADHD is a vibe more for the weird asf music video. I thinkt his came right around when chat gpt's SORA came out and started meshing words/images together and produced some very interesting results.&#x20;

### Cultural Events

* Chat GPT's SORA and video generation came out around this time making really interesting videos.
* This video is the first one I saw really exploiting it.
* Previously, there were limitations to camera tricks and video editing with exceptions that typically took way too long to produce. Otherwise, you'd animate it.&#x20;
* This video has realistic walking brains I've never would see in an animation.&#x20;
