* **On Befall:** George is leaving because Damien's father bought/bankrupted George's business and now he can't afford schooling.&#x20;
  * Anna Reacted by giving him a stella, helping him eat the most expensive meal, and singing as a student crowd.&#x20;
  * Thank you everyone. Thank you everyone for such wonderful memories.&#x20;
  * Damien gave George his own school supplies. They're super expensive, but gives them to George so they "don't forget about us." Super wholesome since George wanted to mildly ruin Damien's life just a moment ago. Fight curelty with kindness to show them the _better_ way instead of resenting/fighting back.
