#### Letter from Randolph

Simon,

My name is Randolph Moore. I am the lead technician and have worked here at Mount Holly for over a decade. I was thriled to discover you have found our humble lab and have begun to run some experiments of your own. I tend to keep an eye on the small spikes in radiation levels on the estate as it's one of the only ways I can monitor your progress from the outside. (All off-site connections to the terminal network have been disabled during your stay).

There has been much speculation among the staff about the progress you've been making in the house and they were all quite excited when I reported that you have been successfully running experiments! I wanted to write to you to let you know that even though you may not see us, we are rooting for you!

Best of luck on the experiments and if you like I'll continue sending letters with some helpfull tips for you.

-Randolph

### Schoolhouse

  * 38 years of schoolmaster in a tiny facility.&#x20;
  * Lady Epstein fundraised.
  * Mrs. Peterson, future principle/succcessor.
  * Baron Sinclair is the architect.&#x20;
  * "Remember to give Mrs. Peterson her gift"
  * Whoever wrote this is anticipating death.&#x20;
* Contains one of the valves needed for the torch puzzled.&#x20;

### Music Room

Sheet music is seven pages, but I only have four of them. Words in bold are:

* first, words, on, do?, the...
* Page 8: stone cut by hand, and letters wrought, do spell our secrets carved from thought. A **message** read is of ten lost among the bold words spoken soft. The note is read, the letter is not.
*

### Apple Orchard

### Tomb

* A very well written letter to me, simon, explains how tradition chains us down, but we follow traidition like it is our destiny, even though it may hold us back. During our youth, we ponder, dream even. During our death, we only have regrets.
* Each of our journeys come to a conclusion here in the tomb. This floor plan is the definitive dead end... or is it?
* There seem to be several trap doors.

### Workshop

*



### Electrical Room

Revealed in the office terminal is an email telling you the states that each light should be on. Once you put them in the right sequence, it unlocks a secondary room with a lever. Pulling that lever reveals a gemstone cavern.



### Gemstone Cavern

* Unlocks after solving the electrical puzzle.
* Letter: there's one more cart locked on a short track and too difficult to move from the reservoir side. Blocking the passage & needs to be moved from the "other side". There are 2 other ways to get into the site from the blocked side.

* Didn't seem to be anything else there.. unusually empty.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



### Routunda

* Rotates w/ press of a button; nothing super interesting
* Oh that's not rue. UPDATE: the secret garden key works in the routunda!!!
  * Basement key didn't work which surprised me, but try other doors next time?

### Rumpus Room

The great Alzara

* First pass: the hidden room is separated by a body of water?
* Second:  with Alzara. Look into my future. Car broke down by ruined mannor/building? Decrepit, rundown, disrepair. Sees EIGHT red envelopes upon 8 pedistals. In them are 8 letters by 8 different hands. Numbered. Which only ever I shall find/read 7 of them.

#### Third Pass

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Fourth pass. Hears the pattering steps of children running throgh the forest. The joyful echos of laughter in the courtyard. I see an old man sitting in an even older chair. A seat that has served many generations. Each with their own stories. Each with their own secrets. Each with their own endings. But all, in the same chair. What you have heard here has been forseen by the great Alzara.... until the dawn of the following day I will have nothing more to say.

#### Fourth Pass

* Faintly in the midst, I see a figure. (King/sword). A statue cradeled in a courtyard of sentinel stone.&#x20;
* You will find yourself one day wandering these paths; walking in the footsteps of the path. Wandering and waiting.
* Searching for a shadow that will never be cast. Longing for the day to end. The hours to pass.&#x20;



### Secret Garden

* Spreads fruit throughout the house, which is a nice perk.
* Accessible using the secret garden key on the east part.
* Algning all the arrows reveals a secret lever for the antechamber.





### The Precipce

#### Chess Game

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (813).png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (814).png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* There exists a chess or puzzle game resembling the rooms. I suspect if one pays attention to which pieces lie in which rooms, this would unlock a secret.
*

#### Letter regarding Thomas Sinclair and Buried Chambers

A letter from the foreman names Tomas Sinclair the current client in 1915. Someone might've had the chambers deliberately buried.

#### Foreman's Copy - Realm & ? Sigils of the Past and Present by William R. Willard (1905)
