# Kerbal Space Program

I'm learning this to learn the essentials about aerodynamics because I am learning aestrodynamics for reasons. This is a good educational game that rewards you for understanding physics in aestrodynamics.&#x20;

## Rocketry

### Forces

First, the center of mass needs to be ahead of the center of pressure/thust/lift. Maybe it provides some static stability. Anyways - this guy explained the rationalle well in my opinion:

Generally, keeping the mass/forces centered & symmetric is good.&#x20;

### Control

According to the manual, you need both player input & control sources.

* **Player Input**: probe cores, manned pods.
* **Control Sources**: apply forces to the vessel (airflow, torque, gimballed engine, thrusters).

### Types of Rocket Engines

* **Liquid Fuel Engines**: primary engines w/ variable thrust and require tanks of liquid fuel and oxidizer.
* Solid Rocket Booster (SRB)s cannot be throttled or shut off.
* Ion Engine: family of low thrust engines are good for probes. Run on Xenon gas & electric charge and useful for long, low thrust burns.
