# Breaking Up Hard Tasks

Plan for this page:

* Summary of tools/technologies I used.
* Links to "[discipline](../principles-and-values/discipline.md)" if it's more of that.
* Some consistent model to describe tools/tech. Maybe for each app:
  * Summary
  * Advantages
  * Disadvantages
* Links to Jira or big task-tracking project management tools.

## Example

Here is an item on my todo list that I am procrastinating by writing this article:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2021-12-27 at 00.57.10@2x.jpg>)

Like any computer scientist does, take a hard task and turn it into smaller tasks. Then use multithreading and run the calculations concurrently.

But first - why is this a good application to break up into smaller tasks? Here's what I think:

* This has lots of moving parts: _researching how to write, revise, get advice._
* It's dependent upon other people: _emailing requests for letters of recommendation, advice._
* _Therefore, this is a good candidate to break up into smaller tasks._

#### Pencil and Paper or [Battle Mat](https://smile.amazon.com/Chessex-Role-Playing-Play-Mat/dp/B0015IQO2O/ref=sr\_1\_13?crid=J63SKGLNQUA\&keywords=Battle+Mat\&qid=1640585275\&sprefix=battle+mat%2Caps%2C1051\&sr=8-13)

The first things I recommend is trying to model your problem in a flowchart on pen/paper. This is almost meta in that you're breaking down the problem of breaking down problems because you'll use this information to choose the correct model.
