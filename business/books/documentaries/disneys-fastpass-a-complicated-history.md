# Disney's Fastpass - A Complicated History

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yjZpBq1XBE" %}

## History

* Bruce Luval joined as an industrial engineer (optimizing processes to make things more efficient).
* He used computerized-systems to make simulations.
* Their original A-E system produced a false bias.

### Reactions to Queues

* Switchback is the zig-zag which organized/condenced lines. Because they were face-to-face, they could interact with other strangers back when they used to do that.
* Later, it became degrading. They tried to make lines shorter than 15 minutes & hide parts of the queue so guests can't visualize how long the line it really is.
* You can have the greatest show in the world, but if there's a 3hr wait, it's going to be a disappointment.

### Laval's Registration-Only System

* Guests get a _time_ and be seated immediately.
* First, it was nearly impossible to make sure they would arrive on-time.
* Also, if something went wrong, a line would have to form.&#x20;
* Instead, they had a reservation & standby line. The ratio to reservation to standby lines can be adjusted without pissing people off as much.
* The virtual-queue guests waited less & were far more satisfied. Tests showed those using the virtual-queue systems spent more time at shops & eating.
* He thought it'd be free & available to all visitors as not to create different _classes_ of park guests.&#x20;
* Each guest could only have one fast-pass at a time.&#x20;

#### Behind the scenes

1. Each attraction's data would be stored in a computer around there
2. Determines the return times being printed out
3. Connected to servers so they prevent guests from having multiple things.
4. Kiosk would cease giving out fast-passes if it were broken or something went too wrong.

### Learning Curve

* Many guests didn't know/understand the program.
* It was referred to as "Disney's best-kept secret". It was a virtual queue so it was first-come-first-serve but they were put in a preffered queue. Therefore, it affected the rate at which the standby queue moved.&#x20;
