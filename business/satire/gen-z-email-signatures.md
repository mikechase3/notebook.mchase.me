# Gen Z Email Signatures

I love the bluntness. It's also concerning. Here are some of them I found from TikTok. I'm adding my name to them so I can read them later and pretend it's me, but I probably wouldn't use these because I've been taught that's _unprofessional_, but gen-z be like "professionalism is bulls\*\*\* anyways." I prefer to be professional, but on teams that I actually care about and probably not the bullcrap ones they currently have.&#x20;
