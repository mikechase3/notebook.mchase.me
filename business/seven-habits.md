# Seven Habits

## Introduction

I've always been systematic in everything I do, and one of these systems is Franklin Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Franklin Covey is super systematic, someone I idolize in some ways. He's known for this book, but also a series of planners and materials to organize nearly all aspects of your life and business plans. In developing my own principles, values, and goals, Franklin Covey has been essential to my success.

If you have not read the book, the blog post below is a high-quality, accurate summary of his principles:

This page contains the theory and how it relates to stories happening in my life. I may add my own principles later as I see fit.

## Ineffective Methods: Things that Don't Work

### Character Labels

* _Patience is a Virtue_ is wrong in my book.&#x20;
  * Life is short and death is very long, so I'm happy to be impatient.
  * Note: in this example, I exclude perseverance and grit. That's different than raw patience.
  * Speakers who take too long to make their point, but we don't cut them off because it's rude.
* Character labels do not work because there is a _spectrum_.&#x20;
  * Not enough patience makes you irritable and hard to work with.
  * Too much patience will result in wasted time, talking to someone who also wants to do/discuss something else but might perceive you wanting to listen and so he keeps talking until you both die.
  * The right amount of patience allows you to respectfully interrupt him/her when you get the point so you can stop wasting time.



## Self Mastery

### Be Proactive

### Begin with the End in Mind

### Put First Things First

## Develop Teamwork

### Think Win-Win

### Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood

### Synergize

## Continuous Growth

* Evolution is&#x20;
