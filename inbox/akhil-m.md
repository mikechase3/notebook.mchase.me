## Human Factors

Basically it's how humans interact with systems.&#x20;

* Product: anything you're building
* System: group of products that are performing work
* Evaluation: Testing/understanding the product you're building
* Usability: operator's ability to use the product in the way it was intended
* Heuristics: rules of thumb
* Theory of mind: the ability to understand others mental state
* Joint Activity: A set of two or more agents working together to perform an activity
* K-Level Reasoning: The way in which we understand and attribute others mental state & reasoning.
* Heuristic Evaluation: separate topic.

## Examples of Heuristics

* **Nielson Norman**: Most commonly used in practice
* **Schneiderman's Golden Rules of Design**: another common set, but developed after nielsen
* **Joint Activity Heuristics**: he advanced the slide too quickly...

### Neilson Norman

* Stem from 1990s.
* There's 10 things
  * Visibility of system status
  * Match between system & real world
  * User control & freedom
  * Consistency & Standareds
  * Error prevention
  * **Recognition rather than recall**:&#x20;
    * when using a product of any kind, it's really hard to re-call long term memory. It's hard to recall some knowledge.&#x20;
    * So if you can recall that, it's important to support that.&#x20;
    * Common example: in video games when using new controls, show the buttons which to click while the controler is on-screen because they don't have to go back to the controller.&#x20;
    * If they see the controls on-screen, it provides cues.
  * Flexibility & efficiency of Use
  * Aesthetic & Minimalistic Design
  * Help users w/ errors
  * Help & Documentation
* On user/control and freedom: you should give the humans control on how to use the product & not make that into a set standard of controls so they can explore & make sure they're learning the product.

### Schnidermann

* Very secific feedback&#x20;
* Good design standards & all...

### Joint Activity Design Heuristics

* These are built from emperical evidence of human-machine teaming in cognition
* Supports macro-cognitive functions.&#x20;
* MACROCOGNITION: a description of the cognitive functions that are...?&#x20;
* Usability heuristics switch between guidelines & patterns, but cognitive research teaming already can fill that gap?
