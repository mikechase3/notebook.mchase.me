# File Organization

I spent an enormous time on tons of time management platforms and wish to share my results.

## Requirements

* Keep everything. Destroy nothing. It's my sacred time capsule.
* Organize into hot and cold storage. Two file pools.
  * Hot: Dropbox, Google Drive, Cloud Storage.
    * Encrypt "Sensitive" documents.
  * Cold: unencrypted, stored on NAS, access over VPN and SFTP/SAMBA login. (What other layers can I add to make it accessible but secure?)

## Rules

1. Split into broad subsections/groups:
   1. Career
   2. Maintenance
   3. Leisure
   4. Relations





## SCRAP

11/18 test debugging why isn't this syncing with git.
