# Why Meh Matters- Spotting & Shifting Languishing at Work

## Presenters

* Dr. Emily Myers (711 HPW Organizational Health & Development Officer)
* Ms. Stephanie L Dunkle (HQ Organizational Health & Development Officer)

They are also both Air Force, ICF certified coaches!

## Objectives

1. Define what languishing is and how it differs from burnout/depression
2. Recognize common signs of languishing in yourself/colleagues
3. Understanding the impact of languishing on workplace engagement, motivation, and well-being
4. Identify strategies individuals/leaders can use to move from languishing towards flourishing.&#x20;

## What is Languishing

* The term was coined by sociologist _Corey Keyes_ to describe the absence of mental well-being.&#x20;
* It's the empty-middle of mental health, where you're not sick, but you're not feeling well either.&#x20;
* All government employees are experiencing stuff like COVID. Uncertainty, etc. Coping and managing in the COVID-era space might help you manage how to cover federal RIFs.

## How Languishing Manifests

1. **Apathy**: reduced sense of purpose or progress.&#x20;
2. Reduced sense of purpose or progresss
3. Feels emotionally flat
4. Feels unmotivated or aimless.

* It's hard to put yourself in a frame of mind where you can execute this thing & it's going to make a difference.&#x20;
* Instead, think: _what can I do that will impact today? Next week?_
* Everyone is busy. Others are working remote. Feels disconnected/removed and it drives how you're feeling. If there's things that might make an impact, pick the most appealing and think of them like little experiments. See how it lands. If it sticks, do more of that. Otherwise, try something a little different.

## How's it show up at work?

* It's often misattributed to laziness or performance issues if you're not recognizing what's really happening.&#x20;
* Feels like meh, sort-of aimless, potentially having trouble focusing, feeling brain fog, feeling tired/disorganized. A disconnect from your mission/purpose. Low energy/engagement. Avoiding challenges/collaboration you would normally jump on. Collaborating less. Feeling like you're less focused and creative.&#x20;
* It's not that you don't have the skills/ability to succeed, but more like "does my work really matter?"&#x20;
* They say it's not a low-performance issue at all.&#x20;
  * Don't know if I agree with that.
  * I feel like I'm low-performing sometimes.

## Why's it matters?

It impacts:

1. Productivity: reduced output, missed deadlines
2. **Creativity**: less innovation, lower risk-taking
3. **Retention**: greater turnover, lower morale.
4. **Health:** drifts into anxiety, burnout, and depression over time.

* Languishing drains your potential quietly and chronically.&#x20;
* Languishing is not an intentional act like quiet quitting. It's a state of being that can be influenced by others as well.

## Data Snapshot

What's the data show?

Some assumptions? Older people especially struggle to control my own destiny & hgave some level of autonnomy in my daily work which is one kind-of connection. Higher feelings of self-efficacy. Once you're over 55, you can say "if it gets any worse, I've got an exit strategy." The higher up you are, the more likely you recognize you have all the information. When you're down the ladder, there's a question about what's driving what I'm doing?

## How to Regain Momentum

* Flow Activities: tasks that challenge and absorb you (Dan Pink)
  * goals are clear
  * Feedback is immediate
  * Most important, in flow, the relationship between what you had to do & what you could do is perfect
  * A notch or two above your current abilities (zone of proximal development)
* Facilitating Flow
  * Focus blocks: schedule a distraction-free work time
  * Micro-goals: set one small, clear goal, per day.
* Thinking through the most important/impactful things you can do during the week that align with your values & job function & trying to schedule that out throughout the week proactively. We tend to think more creatively when we're low-energy. When we're high-energy, do the deep research.
* TIP: ask "what's my role in this meeting"&#x20;

* Step away from your desk to walk/talk
* Exercise & recharge
* Switch to manual labor like organizing things.
* Beach and a cold drink (so vacations?)
* Prayer
* Time to not think about anything. Let your mind wander.
* Watch TED talks
* Industry meetings, connections, networking.

## Strategies for Teams & Leaders

Normalize talking up & speaking out about these types of feelings.&#x20;

## Action Steps to Take

* Ask better check-in question
  * e.g. "What's giving you energy"
* Revisiting team rituals
  * Do they build connection?
  * Or just efficiency w/o connection
* Continue to be relentless about removing things that aren't value added
  * Do more w/ less
* Protecting deep work & downtime (model boundaries).
* You're more likely to actually follow through with something if you publicly say you want to commit to it or have an accountability partner that you work with.&#x20;

## Contributing to Conversations

* Someone finds it easier to ask them to tell them about themselves. That's a good tool.
* What's everyone's favorite topic (because that's the one they know to best?)
* Try to pick out one point to follow-up and talk with them later
  * Hey, I heard you say XYZ, can you tell me more about it?
* BRING FOOD INTO THE OFFICE!
* Complementing teammates.
