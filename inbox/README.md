# Project Backlog

I used to maintain all of these on Gitlab, but it's an O(n^2) problem trying to organize my life around unfinished projects. Therefore, I am moving them here and archiving them on Gitlab and limiting myself to how many active projects I can maintain at a time, which will probably ten. Currently, there are hundreds.
