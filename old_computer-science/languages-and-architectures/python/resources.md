| [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python) | Pretty comprehensive. |  |
| Code Wars |  |  |
| Coding Bat |  |  |
| [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-in-java-why-you-should-and-where-to-start-39022d15655d/) | Great article for **getting started.** |  |
| Hyperskil.org | Amazing, guided programs. Integrated with PyCharm IDE. Grades code style. | $50/month, but a 3-month trial. Aka Jetbrains academy. |
| [RasPi Beginners Guide](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/books/beginners-guide-4th-ed) | `turtle` module and `pygame` are both used \(ch 5\). | Great for absolute beginners. It's one step up from scratch, and uses a real programming language. Scratch is covered in chapter 4. |
| Programiz | Best documentation for Python I've seen. | Also has a Python app that's ok, but is missing a lot of reference. |
