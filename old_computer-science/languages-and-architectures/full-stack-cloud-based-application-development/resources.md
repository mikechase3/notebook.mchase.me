* Checkout the "Learn Web Development" section. Especially the "[see also](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn#see\_also)" section.
* There's also a lot of [developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) which are explained.&#x20;

### W3 Schools

* Lots of well-documented references with examples you can try out on-the-fly.

### XUL (HTML/CSS/JS)

{% embed url="https://www.xul.fr/javascript/language.php" %}

* Lightweight. Only has the basics.
* I recommend it as a resource for beginners not familiar with syntax.
* You won't get an information-overload.

### OverAPI (CSS/Javascript/Python/NodeJS/Express/More)

* OverAPI is like a giant cheat-sheet.
* Everything links to official documentation (like MDN in the case of Javascript, pictured below).

#### Books I Love:

The HTML/CSS/JavaScript books here are aimed for beginners. They are designed beautifully which makes reading fun.

People like this one - though I haven't read it. It doesn't deal with JS specifically:

You're able to share and get feedback from a community on your projects, so that's pretty cool:
