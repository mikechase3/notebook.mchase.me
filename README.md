# Mike Chase's Research

## Projects

Not for public use most of the time, but occasionally I share what I build:

### Currently Exploring (Updated Jun 2024)&#x20;

* [Unreal Engine Networking](compscidev/game-development/unreal-engine/ue5-networking/)
* Some outdoor adventuring!



#### On My Radar:

1. Python [stdlib](compscidev/languages-and-architectures/python/standard-library/). There's a lot of cool built-ins there that should work on most computers! I've been brainstorming a customized messenger application for our lab & our frequently rotating staff.
2. Exploring [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/?authuser=1#scrollTo=Nma\_JWh-W-IF)
3. Django: try & make a website/interface for an[ IT business](https://www.dam-it.tech/) I might build.

## Study Decks

Some are listed as CSVs on this website.

* Some decks are stored in the `Studies` app.
* Scattered throughout filesystems as CSVs; this notebook.

## Fair Use for Copyrighted Content

* Nobody uses my notebook.
* Everything should fall under "fair use"
* If you have a problem - shoot me an email.
