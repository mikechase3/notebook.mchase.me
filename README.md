# Mike Chase's Research

## Rules

1. Split into broad subsections/groups:
   1. Career
   2. Maintenance
   3. Leisure
   4. Relations



## Experiments

#### For File Organization

Keep Files Organized

```markdown
for any new project:
    while not-useful:
        if isFile:
            
        pass  # keep on the original platform
        

placeInInbox(newFile)
```



1. Scrapework can start on any platform until it's useful.
2. Then,&#x20;
3. GDrive -> Projects for active projects
4. 025 -> "Archive"
5. On mchase.synology.me/192.168.1.200 (SMB, SFTP, SSH) for the real archives.



1. What if I had a 'drafts' page & moved things here when I'm done for completed projects instead of this inbox that I never clean up here?
