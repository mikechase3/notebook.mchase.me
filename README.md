## Active Projects

* [Hands On Machine Learning w/ Sci-kit Learn, Keras, TensorFlow](compscidev/ai/courses/hands-on-ml.md)
  * [Google Collab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/)
* Getting CACs to work with Ubuntu.

## On My Radar:

1. Python [stdlib](compscidev/languages-and-architectures/python/standard-library/). There's a lot of cool built-ins there that should work on most computers! I've been brainstorming a customized messenger application for our lab & our frequently rotating staff.
2. Django: try & make a website/interface for an[ IT business](https://www.dam-it.tech/) I might build.

## Study Decks

Some are listed as CSVs on this website.
