## About The Author

* Main site is at mchase.me, so check that out if you want serious answers.
* **Pretend this is all fiction**: This is a "notebook" not an authoritative/trustworthy source of information. Since this is public on the internet, details about my personal life have been largely changed such that they are factually inaccurate. For example, I might drop into a lost hamlet monologue and change "when I grew up in Ohio" to "in Colorado" where I change details that don't matter, but the hard-science about computing will generally hold true unless I really screwed them up. I also always try to put a works cited or directly link to my source (because for copyright things... "I'm" not hosting it - I'm just pointing to a link to an existing source that I don't control which is legal, just like sharing something on twitter).&#x20;
* **Lost Hamlet Monologues** (not _my_ term but it's fitting): if you see this section anywhere, you can skip it. It's partially a reminder for how I came to the conclusions that I am about to present/share so that if anyone asks me about the credibility/trustworthiness of what I'm talking about:
  * First, I'll refer them to the "Pretend this is all fiction" bullet point.
  * But also, I can remember my evidence and thinking, especially for complex arguments for things like "how to solve global warming". That's a big question and so I'll start off by journaling/rambling & giving essentially a Lost Hamlet Monologue

#### Why "Pretend this is all fiction"?

I want others to question/criticize others work just like I'm doing. Also, this is a notebook. If I want to turn it into a publication, I'll do that and place that deliverable somewhere else.

* p: if you pour a bucket of water on me, I'll be wet.
* p: if you pour enough water on the sun, it'll be wet.
* p: you can pour water on any physical object composed of atoms and it'll become wet.
* p: water has [adhesive/cohesive  _(it sticks to things)_ properties](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/strong-polar-bond-between-water-molecules-creates-water-cohesion), so if water is poured on by more water, it is wet.
* c: water is wet.

_I just wrote a convincing argument, but I just made this up. Actually, I just made up the fact that I made this up because I heard it from somewhere but have no idea and it's easier to say I "made it up" because then I don't have to explain it. And maybe I made it up because I probably misremembered that argument but anyways, this has no scientific evidence/basis and I'm arguing by logic and not science and there's probably lots of underlying truths about water that I don't know about because I'm not a hydraulics engineer. (If you are - fork this). A google research reveals that the top search results confirm water is wet in case you were wondering._
