OK - Two intelligent articles from VOX. The first is the "charts on gun violence" that is worth a good look. I always like real numbers and information over people's "anecdotal evidence" - meaning when Conservatives say, "What about Chicago?" The overall numbers are in favor of limiting or reducing gun ownership for safety.

Second is about the Supreme Court case that I think was very wrongly decided, and how it ruins the debate in this country. It shows how deadly HANDGUNS are. That's even a different issue than machine guns, which I have a real constitutional problem with citizens owning.

I also heard the argument yesterday from someone - don't use the term "Gun Control." No one likes control and the freedom caucus does not want to be controlled. Most people want to be safe, and especially women find "safety" appealing. It's playing the word game, and the Republicans have gotten very good at it - more liberal and sane people need to play the same game.
