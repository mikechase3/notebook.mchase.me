## On "The Art of Gathering"? (Title might not be right)
* I listened to a *No Stupid Questions* podcast regarding group gatherings & what makes good groups.
* The topic was a *book club** & they used that as an example. Good book clubs have:
  1. An authoritative figure w/ house rules.
  2. Exclusivity (creates a sense of belonging & feeling special/important).
  3. Rules against new members because they don't have prior knowledge nor shared experiences/friends.
* Should I look at [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs)?
