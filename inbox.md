## On "The Art of Gathering"? (Title might not be right)
* I listened to a *No Stupid Questions* podcast regarding group gatherings & what makes good groups.
* The topic was a *book club** & they used that as an example. Good book clubs have:
  1. An authoritative figure w/ house rules.
  2. Exclusivity (creates a sense of belonging & feeling special/important).
  3. Rules against new members because they don't have prior knowledge nor shared experiences/friends.
* Should I look at [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs)?*


## Stocks and Bonds
* Currently, I buy index funds.
* But I'm in tech & tech is booming.
  * I've got tons of my portfolio in tech
  * Which goes against my "just index it" philosophy
  * Is that risky? AI is changing the world & has been over last ten years.
  * But now chat gippity came out and it's... oversaturated?
* Anyways - how do I know when to sell $MSFT, $AMZN, if we're innnnnnnnn a bubble?
  * And when do I get out?
