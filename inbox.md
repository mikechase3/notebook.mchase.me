| The only way to view the truth of life, is to stand apart from it, to see the consequence of every thought, every action.

| Do you know your values and what you're really going after? I've learned from conversations with psychologists, and from my own experiences, that what people want arises from them a) being wired a certain way and b) trying to satisfy subliminal needs that are deeply hidden within them and typically influenced by their experiences from times long before they can remember. | Principles and Values app                         | <p>I loved the part subliminal needs hidden deeply within.

| In relationships, don't talk about your rleationship too much. Keep things between each other only.
