# Super Crooks

## Electro-Boy

How do you become a superhero? If I waked up with some superpowers, what would you do with them? The first episode tries to figure out what you should do as a superhero. We'll start by developing the superpowers and sharing it with a friend. Then, you have to find someone in-trouble. But what if your town doesn't have any crime? You have to write your own script.

Remember when you said the other day about wanting to meet a super hero? That's what Janice said to him, but then she was like "whatever - sorry, I've got to go", but kind-of rudely. So, he wanted to show-off his skills but then fell in the water & drowned/killed everyone. His best friend filmed all of it. Then, he became a super-villain.



## Episode 2 - Kasey

Johnny Bolt is grown-up and out of prison. He says he's planning to stay out-of prison in San Francisco. He's a pretty confident guy and goes back home to his girlfriend.&#x20;

Then, there's some villain stories. There's Dillain who left & invested $5M into something. A few years later he shows up in Japan & gets himself and gets a girlfriend in Japan & lives the good life. Then, one of his old dies dies tragicaly. Same with one of his favorite sex workers & drug-dealers in batimore. Then his brother, mother, step-brothers, and everyone else he knew died. That's how the bastard operates & takes care of things. What a terrible super power.&#x20;
