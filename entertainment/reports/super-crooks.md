# Super Crooks

## Electro-Boy

How do you become a superhero? If I waked up with some superpowers, what would you do with them? The first episode tries to figure out what you should do as a superhero. We'll start by developing the superpowers and sharing it with a friend. Then, you have to find someone in-trouble. But what if your town doesn't have any crime? You have to write your own script.

Remember when you said the other day about wanting to meet a super hero? That's what Janice said to him, but then she was like "whatever - sorry, I've got to go", but kind-of rudely. So, he wanted to show-off his skills but then fell in the water & drowned/killed everyone. His best friend filmed all of it. Then, he became a super-villain.
