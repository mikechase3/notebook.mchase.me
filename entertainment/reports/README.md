# Anecdotal Reviews

Reports isn't the right term - more like commentary of what I'm watching. In chronological order of roughly when I watched it.

* **Charley Brown**: characters at their youth; good to watch as kids and my dad watched them with us. Discusses existential struggles, friendship/community, innocense versus wisdom, perseverence and resiliance.
  * **Great Pumpkin (Halloween)**: linus hopes for great pumpkin but is disappointed and misses Halloween. He's lonely, like us oftentimes. Likes it tho. Good traditions with Halloween.
  * **Christmas**: what's the meaning of XMAS? Commercialism or peace/love/goodwill? He's compassionate about his dinky XMAS tree.
  * **Thanksgiving**: gratitude, ftogetherness - that's why we celebrate Thanksgiving. Share food with friends.
* **Finding Nemo**: I watched this a ton.
* **Mr. Rogers Neighborhood**: watch the testimony before congress so he got funding. Also a good movie with Tom Hanks. Discusses death & hard issues with kids so they can communicate & manage their feelings that adults still struggle with. Tom Hanks made a movie that's touching too.
* **Muppets**: old shows were classics. Brought in celeberties too. Muppet Movie is a classic.
* **The Princess Bride**: Love between Buttercup and Westley. Friendship. Humor/Satire. Adventure/Heroism. It's a timeless tale of joy and hope.
* **The Grinch Stole XMAS**: good XMAS movie. Teaches you about love & why you shouldn't steal other people's presents.
* **Wizard of Oz**: first color movie. Courage & scarecrow, Tin woodman, Cowardly lion. Seeks a brain, heart, and courage but they had it within themselves. They just had to overcome their own illusional obstacles. Inner strength & self-discovery.
* **Chroniucles of Narnia** I only watched lions/witch/wardrobe but it was captivating as a child.
* **The Matrix**: was a cool sci-fi.
* **Spider Man**: good moments. Very wholesome secretly hiding powers and coolio romances. I watched the original series with dad & modern movies are good too
* **Joker**: watched with John S & it was our favorite. Just WOW. Mental health is a joke in society. Consequences of mistreatemnt. It's not his fault, but his identity was shaped by trauma and chaos and anarchy. Teaches you to rebel against the status quo for improvement. Good commentary on societal issues. State of the art cinemaphotography.
* **Hunger Games**: society and big brother weird communist stuff with powerful people using individual for 'fun' basically.
* **Lego Movie**: everything is awesome. Creativity/individuality/imagination. Lots of pop culture meta humor.
* **Jackass**: I wanted this movie because there was a swear word in it. It's a stunt movie.
* **2001 Space Oddessy**: programming computers to deny us access to things is very similar to the beaucratic place I work at times. No human in the loop.
* **Kung Fu Panda**: inner peace.
* **Terminator** hasta lavista, baby.
* **Diary of a Wimpy Kid Movie**: friendship, relationships, self-discovery, growth, resliance. Just kid stuff I vibed with.
* **Ghostbusters**: George Jr loved it.
* **Robin Hood**: prince of theives.
* **Dr. Who**: moments with my dad. We'd watch all the classics in front of our CRT TV.
* **Monty Python & Holy Grail**: hahaha
* **Orbiting Human Ciercuis of the Air**: this is a podcast & I need a different section. I fell in love with this radio drama. Narrator & unconfident worker. Great voice acting and personalities. 2018ish. Listened to it in Paris too during my London trip w/ Honors Program.
* **Avatar**: did motion capture and was one of the first I think.
* **Squid Game**: playing deadly games for fun. Survival/desperation. Morality/ethics. Social wage gaps cause people to kill over money. Intense/suspenseful.
* **Fraiser**: think it's about a TV/Radio show. Good moments. Watched with parents.
* **Star Wars**: episode 4. Watch it in a theater or big screen. Awwe/wonder.
* **WhatsItCalled**: sunshine pocket happiness? Erase your brain and forms a new relationship seen differently I think.
* **Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure**: todo
* **Spongebob**: first few seasons only. Need to pirate them because they removeed the "inappropriate episodes" from streaming platforms to keep it PG.
* **Back to the Future**: exciting Sci-Fi, Marty McFly saves the day. Kind-of a meme almost these days but one of my favorite movies
* **The Incredibles**: watched this a ton as a kid too. Played the music in high-school jazz band & it was my favorite piece.
* **A Quiet Place**: excellent foley and great (lack of) sound design. When the characters make noise, they're in trouble!
* **Guardians of the Galaxy**: classic music is great for kicking-butt.
* **Race to Witch Mountain** was a classic and I fell in love with the girl when I was ten or so.
* **Airplane**: learned what jive-speak is. Kinda racist. Really funny moments.
* **Home Alone**: watchihng peoplle get beat-up for sstealing a kid's stuff.
* **Tom & Jerry**: good cartoons. Despite beating each other they're friends... sorta.
* **Star Trek**: Original & next gen are best. I watched Voyager (girl), and deep space nine (meh). Demonstrates concise/great communication.
  * **Original Series**: Kirk (mentioned in 99 luftbaloons). Very human. Impatient, but professional.
  * **Next Generation**: wrote many quotes from Piccard. I should keep a list somewhere.
  * **Movies**: watched the first one on 2024MAY30th for possibly the first time. Don't think I've seen the rest.
* **Support your Local Sheriff**: really funny as a kid, especially scene about fake jails. Respect authority & good people I suppose.
* **Masters of the Air**: only watched first episode for free.
* **Ted Lasso**: great example of how to deal with conflict & the negativity most people have. Teaches you how to be optimistic & positive and the power that has in fostering a strong/cohesive team. His coaching is unconventional & gives me confidence to take risks for what I beleive in. He's empathetic like me & seeks to understand things at a deep level and fails. He learns to forgive and faces tough personal conflicts that inhibit his mental health/abilities to thrive.
* **Pulp Fiction**: Pulp magazines were printed on cheap paper. Stuff was over-the-top, very dramatic, and included generes of adventure/detective/crime/horror. The movie is a mosaic of interwoven stories featuring colorful characters resembling the genre. NSFW. I watched this 2024MAY31.
