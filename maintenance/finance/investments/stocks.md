# Mike Chase's Advice

## My Advice

This is my advice, tailored for individuals aged 20-30.

* Put 6-months worth of living expenses into bonds.
  * Keep 3-month's worth in the bank.
  * Keep additional 3 months in US govt treasuries (with such low APY you essentially lose money)
  * Keep additional 6-months in [BBB+ rated](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/bond-rating.asp) bonds.
* Move all the rest of your money into a marginally riskier asset, an ETF. for me, this is SPY (and sometimes SPYD for lower volatility when uncertain about economy).

### On Individual Stocks

* **Opinion**: You probably can't beat the market w/o market research & reading financial statements so I wouldn't even try. Just invest in `SPY` or an ETF that covers all sectors/industries/etc.
* **Evidence**: [Goldstein, Jacob. Brilliant vs. Boring. _NPR Planet Money_ 2019](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/688018436) and [The Stupidist Thing You can Do With Your Money](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-stupidest-thing-you-can-do-with-your-money/) Freakonomics

### On Options

* Trading options is are like sports betting. You're either right and win lots of money, or you lose all of it.
* I suggest never trading options. The only time it's appropriate is if you have a extreme confidence of what will happen with the market.
* Options are known as being riskier than stocks, but in my opinion, they're just another tool in the gambler's toolkit.
* To not lose all of your money:
  * I suggest using [call debt spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debitspread.asp) to limit gains/losses.
  * You should pretend it's money you'll never see again and limit yourself to only 3%, roughly what I waste by using my credit card instead of paying cash at liquor stores.

### Further Reading

* TODO: Source numbers/statistics about how indexing beats picking/choosing at least 60% of the time. I think the percentage is higher, like 70 or 80% honestly, but don't remember.
