## Forms of Business Organizations

### Sole Proprietorship

* Few formalities
* Complete control
* Profits are taxed as personal income.
* Personal liability & limited funding

### Partnership

* Few formalities (can be accidental)
* Complete control for the partners
* Profits are taxed as personal income (split)
* Personal liability (also for the partner)
* Limited funding

#### Duties as a "partner"

1. **Loyalty**: good faith benefit and disclose, obedience, care.
2. Agreements are a good idea
3. Dissolution is a process.

### Limited Partnerships

This is a possibility, but it's rare.

* **General partners:** people running the thing.
* **Limited partner**: he's limited and is just the money guy. He has no say in how the business is ran, as long as they only invest money, their personal assets are shielded if the company goes under.

### C-Corporations

* It's its own legal entity, so if the business gets sued everyones' personal assets are safe. The coporation has liability, but doesn't protect employees from negligence.
* We form this under **state law** and use an attorney that'll cost $1,000.
* People will own shares of the business.&#x20;
* Shareholders will have voting rights to elect board members.
* Have a duty to identify their employees.
* The shares you own do not dissolve when you die.&#x20;
* **Double Tax**: the corporation has to pay taxes before it's passed to individuals as a divadend.&#x20;

#### Board Members

* They are required to elect officers & managers (CEO, CFO, COO)
* Businesses needs employees to operate and have employee income.
* They'll assemble a "net operating cost for employees."&#x20;

#### C-Corp Responsibilities

* You need to do a meeting-minutes
* It's heavy on formalities to the state government.&#x20;

### S-Corporation

{% hint style="info" %}
Probably the best?!
{% endhint %}

* They do not pay their own taxes.&#x20;
* Income flows immediately to the owners.
* Unlikely to issue stock to raise capital because it's **limited to 100 shareholders only**.  They need to be US citizens.

### LLC

* Still considered a distinct entity.
* Liability is limited to capital contributions.
* Taxes flow through.&#x20;
* Less regulation & formalities. (No yearly minutes).&#x20;
* You must fill out an **Articles of Organization for a Domestic Limited Liability Company**.&#x20;
* Need a registered agent like your attorney for suing you.&#x20;
* How it being managed, what's the purpose. It can be "operate in Ohio and operate a for-profit business".
* Member managed or use the employees/officers system?
* How can we transfer ownership.

### Franchises

Examples: Starbucks, McDonalds, Dominos, Taco Bell, Wendy's.

* Gives you the numbers & formulas for how to operate the business.
* Benefits: recognition & marketing. We all know what Subway is.
* Little creative control: you can't control the subway sign & invent new sandwiches without permission or change your napkins/straws.
* **Oppressive and risky**: they go into bankrupcy because the franchizor has some level of control over what the franchizee does.&#x20;
  * If Subway says "we have a new sign and you have to put it on your store", you have to buy the new Subway sign for $10K and the franchisor is thinking that you need the new signs and will take $4K in profits on that sign.&#x20;
  * They can make requirements about how many employees come. if they don't think it's clean enough you might lose your franchise and it'll go to the C-Corporation. Subway is the worst.

## Raising Money Securities Act of 1933 (SEC & Rules)

They're afraid of fraud. They don't want to raise money & then steal it. If you're raising money by selling a security like stock, bonds, loans,&#x20;

1. Didn't write what #1 requirement was.
2. Do I have a reasonable expectation I'll make money
3. Does someone else run it?

Any time you raise money, you need to be registered with the SEC

* **Prospectus**: you need to have a document&#x20;
* You can avoid this by going to an "accredited investor" who makes $200K+ or $300K+ joint with spouse. Or their net worth exceeds $1M.&#x20;
* Accredited investors mean you don't hav eto file a rule 506.&#x20;
  * You can pick 35 non-accredited investors and tell them about the investment opportunity.&#x20;

### SEC Rule 10b-5

* Don't defraud people
* Don't use confidential information to make money off of it.

### Tipper/Tippee Theory

* Can't give tips and sell what's going to happen.

### Ohio Blue Sky Laws

Exemption: 10 or fewer.

* In Ohio, you can call 10 or fewer unaccredited investors (friends/relatives)

### Angel Investors

Angel investors are typically people who have done well in that industry. That person can tell a little bit whether or not my ideas are going to make money.

* The angel investor might invest because they have an idea of whether/not they'll actually make it.
* They think they're making a good bet.
* About 75-90% of startups fail
* Angel investors want decision-making. They don't want the new person doing something stupid, so if they invest $1M, they're going to want some **decision making** ability to drive directions.
* They want to help me be part of that process
* The _entreprenuers center_ is a network of angel investors.

#### Angel Investor Terms

* They'll be able to convert the loan and flip it into preffered stock.
* **Preffered stock:** you get dividends. When you're making money, we get money.
* **Common stock**: worth more because it can go up in value.&#x20;

## Employee Contracts

{% hint style="info" %}
Put these in my business plan!
{% endhint %}

* **Non-Compete Clause**: if you're working for a business, you can't compete with the company.[ If it's too broad, it'll be deemed unconstitutional.](https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=513\&q=non-compete+supreme+court\&cvid=b984345ab32c46ab95951114c3ffe9a4\&aqs=edge..69i57j0l6.2760j0j1\&FORM=ANNTA1\&PC=U531)
* **Invention Assignment Agreement**: your employer owns & has rights to your inventions. You have to have in the contract that the developer doesn't own the code, but the company owns the code. As a contractor, if I hire a contractor, have in there that I own the code not the other way around.&#x20;
* **Non-Solicitation Agreement**: you won't solicit any business clients, bring over any employees, or use confidential information connected to your current job. You can't steal good employees from your previous boss.

## Readings

Fill out a business model canvas. Develop your minimum viable product and: get fedback, present it to investors, understand technical limitations, add new features. Create a company brand. Give it a name & a domain. Create a logo. Start landing. Find funding sources (crowdfunding, business angels, corporate accelerators). Then, assemble a team: {product manager, technical officer, marketing manager, financer, development team}.&#x20;
* **Selecting the apprpriate legal entity for your tech startup**: discusses corporations, LLCs, etc.&#x20;
