# David Souter and Ethics of Justices

David Souter may be my favorite supreme court justice who set a precedent. Robert Bork nominations.

* **Answer the question without rephrasing the question**
* The senate hearing room is really a TV studio
* Never play games with words
* Show some heart. Remember that every decision affects humans in the end, so don't leave them out of the equation.
* Integrity first; ethics above politics.
* The suprme court justice is independent.
* STARRY DECISIS is important.

> Justice David Souter has died.  Souter was one of the most private, low-profile justices ever to have served on the Supreme Court. He rarely gave interviews or speeches. Yet his tenure was anything but low profile. Deemed a “home run” nominee by Republicans, Souter defied partisan expectations on the bench and ultimately ceded his seat to a Democratic president.As we reflect on his legacy, we wanted to share this episode again.  Produced two years ago, this episode tells the story of how “No More Souters” became a rallying cry for Republicans and inspired a backlash that would change the Court forever.Voices in the episode include:• Ashley Lopez — NPR political correspondent• Anna Sale — host of Slate's Death, Sex & Money podcast • Tinsley Yarbrough — author and former political science professor at East Carolina University• Heather Gerken — Dean of Yale Law School and former Justice Souter clerk• Kermit Roosevelt III — professor at University of Pennsylvania School of Law and former Justice Souter clerk• Judge Peter Rubin — Associate Justice on Massachusetts Appeals Court and former Justice Souter clerk• Governor John H.
