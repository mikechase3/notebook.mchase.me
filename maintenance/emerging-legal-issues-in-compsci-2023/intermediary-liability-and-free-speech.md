## Introduction

* Should 4chan trolls be able to create deviceness through anti-semetic whatevers.&#x20;
* If I'm enabling a way someone can create a deep fake or defamatory statement, I'm injuring someone else's likeness.
* That person who is just trying to make music on Youtube or whatever. Should 4chan be liable?

## Speech on the Internet, Harm, and Who is Liable

* If we host information as a static website that others don't use, we have **direct liability**.
* But when we operate as an **intermediary liability** such as a magazine that writes statements of what others say or as a platform, then it's not as big of a liability.

## Smith v. California

* Way before the internet time period.
* LA in California created a law from booksellers having obscene materials in their possession regardless of knowledge/awareness about the content.
  * It was fears of lewd/nudity that children and adults could access because they didn't want pornography.
  * State of California said the bookstore is liable themselves.
  * But, as a seller of books, who didn't write most of the thousands of books, he doesn't know!
  * He wants to sell the customers' best sellers. But now this law came down said that if any books have obscene materials he's liable.
  * So what about a medical book like a medical book that contains nudity? Could that have potentially "lewd" material and would you even know that's in there?

> The ordinance is ยง 41.01.1 of the Municipal Code of the City of Los Angeles. It provides: "INDECENT WRITINGS, ETC. -- POSSESSION PROHIBITED" "It shall be unlawful for any person to have in his possession any obscene or indecent writing, book, pamphlet, picture, photograph, drawing, figure, motion picture film, phonograph recording, wire recording or transcription of any kind in any of the following places:" "1. In any school, school-grounds, public park or playground or in any public place, grounds, street or way within 300 yards of any school, park or playground;" "2. In any place of business where ice-cream, soft drinks, candy, food, school supplies, magazines, books, pamphlets, papers, pictures or postcards are sold or kept for sale;" "3. In any toilet or restroom open or the public;" "4. In any poolroom or billiard parlor, or in any place where alcoholic liquor is sold or offered for sale to the public;" "5. In any place where phonograph records, photographs, motion pictures, or transcriptions of any kind are made, used, maintained, sold or exhibited."\

Obviously, LA booksellers weren't happy with this, so they filed a first-amendment complaint against the government. They said it would be unreasonable to expect distributors to have a full understanding of the contents of each book they sold. It's not an achievable expectation, but the writers do. Conversely, a distributor wouldn't know or be aware of the material while the author will was what the bookseller authored. **This was deemed unconstitutional & distributors couldn't be liable.**



## Cubby Inc v. CompuServe Inc

1. CompuServe hosted an online news form that was managed by Rumorville USA a daily newsletter.
2. In 1990 Rumorville published defamoratory content about a competitor newsletter run by Robert Blanchard and Cubby Inc.
3. Compuserve agreed the language was a lie & defamatory, butargued that under Smith (above), the ISP was immune from liability because it was a distributor and not a publisher.
4. So CompuServe just "hosts" it, but Rumorville writes all the content. They're not aware of the news they're posting/serving every day. You don't know what they're going to post because you didn't help them create it. You're also not creating the news, just hosting it, so you shouldn't be responsible for any lies that rumorville did?
5. US district court found that CompuServe was **not at fault for allowing all content to go unmoderated**. They didn't make choices upon the news & anyone hosting these forms are not responsible for defamatory statements posted on them.

## Stratton Oakmont Inc v. Prodigy Services Co

* In 1994 an unidentified user of Prodigy's MoneyTalk bulletin board created a post/lie that was damaging about their business and stated they were doing criminal acts.
* Stratton sues Prodigy here. They say they posted the form & also **exercised an editorial role** concerning customer content.&#x20;
  * Let's say MoneyTalk edits & helps change & shape the content so now there's a lie about some other person.
  * You're aware of the content & taking a hand in the creation of it.
* They would be ruled liable for **libel** committed by its customers.

## Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act&#x20;

the Expansion of Internet Immunity from Liability

This is where Twitter basically wasn't liable. Section 230 makes you immune to liability.&#x20;

They really wanted to preserve a competitive free market. They thought that if you were an internet provider that was harmful that you wouldn't want to be liable.

Section 230 makes web providers basically immune unless they take an active hand in the content.

It says "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider"

## Zeran v. AOL

* Case concerned AOLs liability for 3rd party anonymous posts that caused great emotional and professional harm to the plaintiff.
* The calls began as anonymous posts that advertised "naughty oaklahoma t-shirts" and instructed those interested in purchasing them to call Zeran at his home in Seattle, Washington.
* Zeran started calling & asking him thinking he was associated with those posts.
* There was a guy who made some t-shirts in response of an oaklahoma bombing which killed 163 people.
* He said "I'm requesting AOL" to do a takedown. They refused to post any retraction & the information was still out there even though they did a takedown.
* Then there were more T-shirts asking to call Zeran.
* A conservative talk show host communicated that people should continue to call Ken at Zeran's home phone number
* The calls didn't ever subside. He was receiving a lot of harrassment.
* He sued AOL due to their slow removal and their refusal to make retractions.
* **Decision**: the district court & fifth circut agreed that Section 230 "plainly immunizes computer service providers like AOL from liability for information" blah blah blah.
