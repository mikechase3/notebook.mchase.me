## Anonymized DarkNet Markets/Cryptocurrencies

* The dark web or being anonymous isn't bad.&#x20;

## Types of Hackers Categories

## Regulation&#x20;

### Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 18 USC 1030

Criminal law is fulfilled if:

1. You've got a computer.
2. You accessed it.
3. You went beyond authorization.

Boom - that's it.

* **Without authorization**: is a very broad term. It's a heavily criticized law because it's so easy to break this law by accident.&#x20;

### Sharing of Academic Journals

In United States of America v. Araon Swartz, Aron took 30 papers in Harvard & put them on the internet without authorization. As a student, he was authorized to access them, but it was above his authorization to put them on the internet. This violated the CFAA (computer, fraud, and abuse act). Because it was 30 papers, he had 30 or so counts of charges.

Harvard was quite mad. They weren't offering him a plea deal during the process of the trial. The day before, he committed suicide because he thought he was going to go to federal jail for a minimum of 30 years. He really hadn't done that much.

### Honey Pots

* Creates virtual traps&#x20;
* Not legal?

### Hack Backs

* This is still illegal.
* It looks pretty ethical to "hack-back" someone who hacked me.&#x20;
* Anything you collect through 'your own servers' is okay.&#x20;
* Under the CFAA act, it's still illegal to hack-back.
* Potentially, you could hack back into the wrong server or the people hacking you are a part of a larger organizatoin and you do some damage to an innocent party or a facility or get some information that makes a former adversary look vulnerable. It can be seen as an "act of war." For example, if you do a hack-back as GE to some cybercriminals in China, that can be seen as a cyber assault on behalf of the US against China.
* Under the India Act, it's illegal too.



## Readings

### The Love Bug Virus

* The text said "check your email" and there was a file that said `love-letter-for-you` and nobody has seen a virus before so people clicked on it.&#x20;
* From the Philipines.
* As soon as you opened that attachment, it would try to send that email/text to fifty more people.
* The student wanted someone else's password to AOL so he could get online.&#x20;
* He first tested it out in AOL chat-rooms and thought that if he told someone he'd love them that was the most likely what would interact with him.
* It **emailed back stolen passwords to him**.
* Half of the students in the US and 45 million machines worldwide did some **large-scale economic damage**.&#x20;
* He wasn't prosecuted. The Philippines had no law at the time that was appropriate for computer hacking so he didn't violate any laws.&#x20;
