# Hardware and Megapixel Limits

What are the limits of "megapixels?" in a camera? Can we keep manufacturing smaller and smaller ones and what would photos look like? One day, will my mother be able to take pictures of me a football field away and tell me to trim my nose-hair because the cameras pick that up?&#x20;

The highest quality camera I've found as of Jan 2023 is EarthCam's Gigapixel camera; however, it uses optical lenses and makes a sweeping pattern to construct it using "multi-shots" of lower megapixel images. The highest CMOS sensor I found in a consumer camera you can buy has about 100 MegaPixels. Sony has the record with 127.68 megapixels.&#x20;
