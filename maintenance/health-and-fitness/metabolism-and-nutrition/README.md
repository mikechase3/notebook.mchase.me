## Main Ideas

* Water vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, and carbs.
* **Anabolic reactions** build structures & require energy.
* **Catabolic reactions** tear things apart and release energy.
* Metabolism.

## Body Composition

* 64% is water.
* 16% is protein (muscles, sodium potassium, enzymes driving chemical reactions).
* 16% fats.
* 4% minerals.
* 1% carbohydrates.&#x20;

## Metabolism

There are alternate definitions:

* How fast your body burns the fuel
* How good your energy level is.
* Physiologically: metabolism describes every single biochemical reaction.

## Nutrients

They come in 6 major groups:

1. Water
2. Vitamins (fat or water soluible forms; essential in helping the body make nutrients
   1. Vitamin C: helps improve iron absorption.
   2. Vitamin K: crucial to blood clotting.
   3. Vitamin B: important for the production of ATP from glucose.
3. Minerals
   1. Calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous harden bones and teeth.
   2. Iron is a crucial part of hemoglobin.
   3. Potassium, sodium, help maintain your body's PH level (homeostasis?)
4. Carbohydrates
   1. Monosaccharides come from fruits.
   2. Disaccharides come from vegetables.
   3. These usually store energy in the form of glucose which is used for all things.
5. Lipids (Fats; helps for making ATP)
   1. Cholesterol (precursor to estrogen)
   2. Phospholipids
   3. Breaks into glycersoral or fatty acids.
   4. Omega 6 and 3 are "essential fatty acids" because your body can't make them. You need to consume them.
6. Proteins (helps for making ATP)
   1. Per the bulk of muscle & connective tissues.
   2. Ion Channels & Pumps
   3. Enzymes
   4. Meats, dairy products, nuts, fruits. Everything contains some protein.&#x20;
   5. All proteins are made of 20 amino acids.&#x20;
   6. There are 9 essential amino acids that your body needs.
      1. Combine foods like beans & rice.&#x20;
