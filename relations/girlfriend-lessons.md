# Girlfriend Lessons

Little lessons I can piece together into a light-hearted comic series sometimes.

## Bras

* Walmart <- not as good quality.
* Victoria's Secret <- top of the line of mainstream brands.

## Girl Money Math

1. If you and your girlfriend split the cost of ice cream that costs $10.11 and you pay her $6, she made a profit.
2. Cash is a separate entity than your bank account. Bank accounts are used to pay recurring bills. Cash may be used for impulse purchasing first watch breakfasts. Tip money can be spent on anything without guilt of _wasting_ money.
