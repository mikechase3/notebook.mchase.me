# Discipline

## Starting Your Engine

Becoming and staying productive is a lot like starting up and running a manual car. The car has to be reasonably maintained to keep performing optimally, and trying to attack problems in the wrong order is like switching to the wrong gear.

### Step 1: Start With a Timer

First, get out a timer - but choose a fancy one if you have one. My personal favorite is an app called "Timer Plus" for IOS/Android linked below. When I go to work, I use the following 5hr timer to allocate when I'll work, when I'll take short breaks, and when I'll take longer ones.

By using an app, I feel motivated to work until the end of the set time instead of giving up somewhere in the middle when things get hard. I recommend _Timer Plus_, but any timer will do.

### Step 2: Create Goals

If you're motivated enough to have started a timer, congratulations, you're now in second gear.

Grab a piece of paper. Fill in this table, which will have 18 rows. You get a 20-minute long break for each 30 minutes of work you do, with shorter breaks every 10 minutes using the above configuration.

| No.                                               | Goal                                                     | Actual                       | Improve?                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1                                                 | Write step 1                                             | Finish step 1 and started 2. | Is this a good use of my time? |
| 2                                                 | Finish writing step 2                                    |                              |                                |
| $$\begin{bmatrix}3 \\\vdots \\ 18 \end{bmatrix}$$ | _(You can leave goals blank and fill them in as you go)_ |                              |                                |

### Step 3: Power Through

Like a manual car, you're fine once you're in 3rd gear. Getting to 4th/5th gear is dependent upon each situation. For 3rd gear, just remember to keep taking care of your car. During your drive:

* Take prescription.
* Caffeine: coffee or other steady source.
* Listen to loud, hypnotic music in your outer headphones, but wear ear plugs on the inside. This will better tune out surrounding noise and leave you faintly hearing music you enjoy.
