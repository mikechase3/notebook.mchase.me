# Don't do drugs

## Purpose

I know I'm in college and it's unpopular to take a stand against drugs and alcohol, but consuming them lowers your standards for everything you care about. Use alcohol when you're having fun with other people. When you're stressed or lonely or hopeless, don't use alcohol. Instead, refer to this list.

## Why might you start?

### Anxiousness

Yeah, school is tough. Drugs won't make it better. Try dropping your hardest class or the one you feel most unprepared for and you'll get better because you'll have more time to care for yourself!

### Bandwagoning

Solution - find better friends.

### Laziness

Yeah. I have depression phases when I don't want to do anything. Suggest that if you have money, you take a week off and go to the beach or something. Leave your problems behind. Unless you can't because you're in a relationship or have other responsibilities (in which case, you need to inform them you're lazy & need to go somewhere else to cure some temporary depression)

### Loneliness

Don't go out to clubs (around school). Join clubs (at school). I joined Outdoor Adventure Club and we'd go hangout and hike parks.&#x20;

## Other Persuasive Techniques

* Have you ever played a musical instrument? It's quite fun.
* if you have homework, you're not going to get it done any faster.
* "Don't believe whatever the stoners write on the label. The focus cart won't make you any more focused."
* What would your grandpa/grandma think/say?
