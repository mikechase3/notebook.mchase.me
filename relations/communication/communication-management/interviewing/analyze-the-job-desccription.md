## Tips

* Customizing your responses will make you stand out.

## Dealing with Jobs Without Detailed Descriptions

1. Work with your network to see if you can find anything more about the position.
2. Search similar job descriptions for similar roles at similar companies.

## Jobs with Detailed Descriptions

* **Identify Competencies:** highlight all qualifications, duties, and desired competencies. Make special note of things mentioned more than once. The most important parts are listed first.
* **Identify Themes:**
* **Identify your selling points:** Talk about awards and skills I can back up.
* **Gaps/Weaknesses**: be prepared to proactively reframe and react when interviewers react to your weaknesses.
* **Anticipate Questions:** Tell me about your one of your successes. Share an example of your leadership skills (prepare stories about leadership). Walk me through your budget management experience. Why did you leave your theater roll if that's really what you want to do? (Maybe he was fired?)
