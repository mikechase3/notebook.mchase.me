# Reducing Expectancy Violations

I don't exactly know what an expectancy violation is yet, but from the tiny bit of research I did, I found that it has something to do with breaking social norms and causing or performing an unexpected behavior.

Several times in my life `(sw)`, I have produced expectancy violations. SW was the biggest expectancy violation I produced and had negative consequences.

I should identify and reduce any expectancy violations I produce. I don't know what this is yet, but I will be exploring/developing this section.
