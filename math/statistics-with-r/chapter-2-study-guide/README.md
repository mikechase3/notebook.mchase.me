# Chapter 2 Study Guide

## Basic Ideas

* **Sample spaces** describe all possible outcomes of an experiment. We represent this with the variable `S`.&#x20;
* **Experiments** result in unpredictable outcomes.
* **Events** are subsets of sample spaces.

### Combining Events

* **Unions** is just a logical or.
* **Intersections** are logical ands.
* **Complements**: show that sets aren't in a specified event.

### Mutually Exclusive Events

* **Mutually exclusive** is a term describing two events (subsets) that don't share any outcomes.
* If outcomes are mutually exclusive, the following tools can be used:

## Probabilities

* `Probability(<event>)` denotes how probable the event (aka outcome ) is to happen.
* P(event) must be btw 0 and 1.
* If there are multiple events `P{<outcome 1>, <outcome 2>..., <outcome n>}`, and they are mutually exclusive,&#x20;
