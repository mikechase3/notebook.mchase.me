## Describing Data

| Type                      | Equation                                                          | Usage                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Sample Mean               | $$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$$                      | Quick avg             |
| Sample Variance           | $$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} (\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - n \bar{X}^2)$$        | Not used in practice? |
| Sample Standard Deviation | $$s = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n-1} (\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - n \bar{X}^2)}$$  | Measures "spread"     |
| Absolute Deviation        | $$\frac{i}{n} \sum |x_i - \bar{x}|$$                              | Not used in practice. |
| Sample Median             | Pick the middle one or divide by 2 when even.                     |                       |
| Trimmed Mean              | Trim an equal number from each end and compute mean of remaining. |                       |

### Linear Transformations

How do $$\bar{X}$$ and `s` change when the `X` are transformed?

| Final Form                 | Proof                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $$\bar{Y} = a \bar{X} +b$$ | $$\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum a X_1 + b \implies a \frac{1}{n} \sum X_1 + b = a \bar{X}+b$$ |
| $$S_y^2 = a^2 s_x^2$$      | Probably not important.                                                                    |
| $$S_y = |a|s_x$$           | Probably not important.                                                                    |

### Sample Median

* A **sample median** is a number in the end.
* It's the middle most value or the average of the two middle most.

## Trimmed Mean

* Designed to be unaffected by outliers.
* The p% trimmed mean is the mean after removing the largest p% and smallest p% of the data.&#x20;
* If np/100 is not a whole number, we round it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
What is p%? A probability? Percentile?
{% endhint %}

## Outliers

* Outliers are values much different from the rest of the sample.
* While heuristics exist, what constitutes an outlier is context dependent and somewhat subjective.

## Computing Mean/Std with R

```
data = c(7, 11, 3, 6, 5, 11, 47, 8, 8, 6)
```

|                              | Syntax                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Mean                         | mean(data)            |
| Standard Deviation           | sd(data)              |
| Variance                     | var(data)             |
| Compute the 10% trimmed mean | mean(data, trim = .1) |

Trimming removes from both ends and throwing them away. Trimming is like an automated algorithm, while removing the outliers.
