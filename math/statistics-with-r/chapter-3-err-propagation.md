# Chapter 3 Err Propagation

## Measurement of Error

* **Error** is the difference between the measured value and actual value.&#x20;
* **Systematic error/bias** describes is part of the error that is the same for every measurement.
* **Random error** varies from measurement to measurement and averages out to zero in the long run.

### Mathematical Notation

$$
\texttt{Measured value = true value + bias + random error}
$$

| Symbol                      | Meaning                              | Purpose                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| $$\mu$$                     | $$\mu = \texttt{true value + bias}$$ | Measures accuracy.              |
| σ                           | Random error.                        | Measures precision/uncertainty. |
| $$\mu-\texttt{true value}$$ | Bias.                                |                                 |
| $$\bar{X}$$                 | The sample mean                      | Used to estimate bias.          |
| $$\bar{X_1}, \bar{X_2}...$$ | Individual measurements              | Each is independent.            |

* $$\mu$$ is the sum of the true value and bias, $$\mu = \texttt{true value + bias}$$.
* σ is the standard deviation. The standard deviation of the population is the standard deviation of the random error.
