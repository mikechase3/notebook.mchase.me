# Early Geological Theorists

## Learning Goals

* Geologic time: earth's age gives us context for geologic processes and events.
* Plate tectonics: how it has helped us reconstruct the history of the earth.
* Evolution: understanding the development & history of life on earth.

### External Metaphors in Geologic Thought

* Is Geologic history directional or cyclical? When is it cyclical like mountains rising/falling? Or directional meaning humans will be extinct one day.
* Was earth shaped by gradual processes or catastrophic upheavals.
* How do earth and life relate? What is the relationship between major changes in physical and biological earth systems.

### Early Life

* Prokaryotes

### Figured Stones

We looked at stones and learned it was hard to determine if things were organic/inorganic by looking just at rocks.

## Issue: Rock Formation

### Thomas Burnet & the Sacred Theory of the Earth (1635-1715)

He explained that God works in ways that can be observed. It's a way to think of scriptural framework, but think how it's possible to describe God's work through observation.&#x20;

* Adam/Eve: perfection
* Noah/s Flood: ocean holes form.

### The Great Subterranean Ocean

Problems:

1. Where did the water come from?
2. Where does the water go?

Solution: _**the great subterranean ocean**_, this idea is that everything was an ocean and mountains got built-up afterwards?

### The Neptunist View of Rock Formation

#### Old ways of categorizing rocks

|              |                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Primary      | Igneous, metamorphic, metal ores      |
| Transitional | Metamorpized or deformed sedimentary. |
| Secondary    | Sedimentary rock, but no ores.        |
| Tertiary     | Unconsolidated sediments              |

#### Werner's Beliefs

1. All rocks are sedimentary
2. Directional earth history
3. Young earth
4. Even basalt is sedimentary.

#### Problems of Neptunist View

* Where all the water went was ever explained. The origin of basalt and volcanoes was theory was incorrect. They assumed all volcanoes were recent.z

### Genognosy Theory

1. The world is initially covered by a universal ocean.
2. Out of the ocean, primitive rocks are precipitated right onto the earth's irregular core.
3. Crystallization of so much material causes ocean to recede and transitional rocks are precipitated in inclined layers. These two units are universal.
4. Further sea-levels drop and erosion of universal rock units cause the secondary rocks (sandstones, limestone, evaporites, coal, and basalt) to form locally.
5. Finally ocean recedes to today's levels and non marine strata, Alluvium (river gravels), form.

#### Problems

* Where the world's water went (was displaced to) was never explained.

### Plutonists & James Hutton's Theory (1785)

They were usually wealthy people who didn't have to work. James Hutton was a geologist in 1785 and he was trying to understand how to explain the layers of rock that he found in his corn fields, particularly, the gravel of rocks?

#### Beliefs

As outlined in 1785 _The Theory of the Earth_

1. The earth is infinitely old.
2. Earth's history is cyclical
3. Earth processes are gradual
4. Earth's center is hot: it's a machine.
5. Most rocks are igneous.
6. Basalt is an igneous rock.

Werner -> Werner: Start neptunism
Werner --> Hutton: Response via plutonism
Werner --> Hutton: Wrong about bassalt being a "sedimentary" rock. (It's igneous)
Hutton -> Werner: Wins most geology debates w/ good teachers & field geologists
Smith -> Knowledge: establish the idea of extinction.

## Issue: Extinction

The idea of extinction never existed. Humans just live infinitely. How do we explain new things we've never seen before?

### Cuvier's Theory on Neptunism

#### Faunal Succession

In the geologic record, fossil faunas succeed on another in an orderly and determinable fashion. Therefore, rocks of different ages have different fossil faunas.

#### Principle of Fossil Correlation

* Across continents & land marks, we can demonstrate equivalency using fossils.
* For Smith working in great Britain, he can now find important rock units (including valuable ones) by studying rock fossils somewhere else.

#### Extinction Controversy

* Based on studies of fossil elephants & giant sloths, Cuvier recognized that organisms have become extinct.
* Highly controversial: up until this time, there is no concept of extinction.
* He noted extinctions are associated with **earth upheavals** where there's some great earth environment event. There is a violent change in earth and it causes things to be extinct.
* **Catastrophism**: the idea that things exist, become extinct (due to God) and are replaced by new, different, forms. Each fauna was an improvement and the last of these was Noah's flood which leaves.

#### Neptunic Beliefs (Updated)

1. Earth history was beset by violent uphevals that periodically wiped out nearly all organisms.
2. God then created a new fauna to replace the extinct one.
3. All of this happened within Buffon's age of 75K years. Buffon claimed, "A year is to God as a thousand years is to man."
4. Processes are cataclysmic.



### Charles Lyell & Uniformitarianism

This guy is like the Elon Musk of his day.

The only people doing scientific work were rich people. They got to sit around and think. Work was considered beneath them and they'd never work, so all the people driving science are barons and dukes and what not.

Lyell was the student of Reverend William Buckland (1784-1856) who was known for throwing big parties and feeding guests all sorts of different organisms like alligators and ants, so he was basically a celebrity for his eccentric parties.

#### Buckland's Diluvial Theory

This says you can explain fossil locations based on Noah's flood and figure out where the cave deposits are. Buckland was

This relates to Lyell's work because?

* Mollusk's borings in the temple of Serapis deterat the ocean rose and fell in a cycle.

#### Counting Varves

This guy starts counting up layers of [varves](./#undefined) and from one lake deposit, he counts so many couplets he realizes Wagner was correct. He puts together Uniformitarianism.

```
@startuml
Werner -> Werner: Start neptunism
Werner --> Hutton: Response via plutonism
Werner --> Hutton: Wrong about bassalt being a "sedimentary" rock. (It's igneous)
Hutton -> Werner: Wins most geology debates w/ good teachers & field geologists
Smith -> Knowledge: establish the idea of extinction.
Buckland -> Lyell: motivates Lyell to fund science b/c of dilluvial theory.
Lyell -> Werner: start debate no 2

#### Beliefs

1. Earth is infinitely old.
2. Cyclical earth history.
3. Processes are gradual.

#### Lyell's Uniformitarianism

_"The present is the key to the past"_

1. Uniformity of law
2. Uniformity of process (actualism; basis of science)
3. Uniformity of rate (gradualism; testable by observation)
4. Uniformity of condition (non-progressionism)

## Themes

1. Scriptual explanations of Earth's history gradually replaced by scientific observations and theory.
2. The use of observation and experimentation leads to calculations of a much older earth.
3. Competing ideas of directional vs. cyclic histories, and gradual vs. catastrophic processes frame major scientific debates.
4. There are two major debates so far: neptunist/plutonist and catastrophism/uniformitarianism.
5. Understanding context in evaluating "winners" and "losers".

## Misc Resources for Test #1

* Know the Geologic Time Scale
* Know the 3 "Great Theorists of the Earth"

## Power of Uniformitarianism

Uniformitarianism is a powerful tool for interpreting the geology of the earth.

You can look at some sediment and characterize it by _color, composition, size, size distribution (sorting), shape (angular/round), fossils or not?_

## Sediment Deposit Refresher

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (698).png>)

**Ways to identify:** color, composition, size, sorting, shape.

| Quality     | Descriptors                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Location    | Mountains, alluvial fan, fluvial, beach, marine |
| Grain size  | Silt, sand, coarse, gravel                      |
| Composition | Quartz, K-Spar, Clay,                           |
| Color       | Dark (unoxidized organics)                      |

### Boulders

There's these channeled scablands where ice existed one time which carried a bunch of random a\*\*  boulders and sediment left by the ice. Glaciers came through Ohio multiple times and left lots of unsorted sediment and glacial deposits. Anyways, the channeled scablands let you see deep a lot more quickly because it is weirdly mountainous.

1. Realized earth has to be old.
2. Evolution has become an "accepted" idea. Charles wrote "On the Origin of Species" already
3. Catastrophism is a scriptural doctrine.
4. Uniformitarianism _(aka the present is the key to the past)_ becomes the main geological doctrine.

### Diluvial Theory (Noah's Flood Caused Chaos)

There was a lot of unexplained phenomenon that diluvial theory couldn't explain.

* **Old Idea**: Sediments are left by Noah's Flood because only God could cause something so catastrophic.

### Glacial Theory

{% hint style="info" %}
This theory is correct.
{% endhint %}

* **William Buckland** determined that all the sediment deposits couldn't be left by Noah's Flood again
* **Charpentier & Vernetz**: determined glaciers are producing this "chaotic sediment"
* ****[**Louis Agassiz:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis\_Agassiz) **** he was an exceptionally well-known paleontologist (and for being racist and used science to promote racism).
  * He hammers stakes from one side of the valley to another and observes what happens over time.
  * Through an experiment, he determines that glaciers move. It is responsible for till and erratics.
  * The idea of ice moving is catastrophic so this wasn't popular.

### Drift Theory

* **Lyell**: sees icebergs calving off Antarctic glaciers and dropping sediment as they melt.
* Lyell was so attached to uniformitarianism. This leads to mistakes.
* Today, we call rocks that are deposited & don't belong "**Glacial Erratics**".

## The Channeled Scablands

#### What are they?

It's an unusual landscape where really large rocks are eroded into this 1000 ft canyon into the bassalt.

We talked about this in class, but I think this is a good resource to define what they are.

{% embed url="http://www.sevenwondersofwashingtonstate.com/the-channeled-scablands.html" %}

#### What were the original ideas for why it formed?

* Normal Columbia river erosion over time.
* J Harlan Bretz said it happened because of a catastrophic flood.

#### Bretz

* Said it caused by a catastrophic flood.

#### Reaction

* Rejected.
* Geologists correctly pointed out that he had no theory for where the water came from.

#### Resolution

* "I know where the water came from, but I'll be dammed if I tell you"
* When maps were produced and we had satellites, it's clear to see that they are giant ripples. You can calculate how much water you actually need to cause that - and it's a lot.

#### The Real Answer

If you remove a small ice dam, you allow all of this water to flow out.
