# The Age of the Earth

In the 1800s or early 1900s, everyone is trying to figure out how to build a geologic timescale. In this segment, we're going to figure out why the Geologic Timescale is useful and why geologists and chemists were all trying to figure this out.



## Review

### Superposition

* The first thing that had to happen was that we had to create a "series of events".
* Steno said we can go from oldest to youngest, without having to know a specific date.

### Law of Cross-Cutting Relationships (Hutton)

We know a rock unit or structure is older than any rock unit or structure that cuts across it.

### Law of Inclusions (Steno)

A rock or fossil that occurs as an inclusion within another rock must be older than the rock that surrounds it.

### Law of Faunal Succession (Smith)

* Fossil faunas succeed on another in an orderly and determinable fashion.
* Therefore, rocks of different ages have different fossil faunas.

### The Principle of Fossil Correlation (Smith & Cuvier)

* Similar assemblages of fossils are similar ages, and thus, the rocks that contain them are of similar ages.

How do we do this in-practice?
