## Groundwater Problems

### Dry Wells

#### Groundwater Contamination

* All human activity produces waste. If we dump it, it goes into the groundwater system which isn't that good. Gas tanks rust and spill. So do septic tanks.

* In-place waste: once things get into the water, it will diffuse and migrate with the ground water so you get this thing called a contaminant plume.
* Plumes are **migrating** contaminations. It gets really difficult to clean up.&#x20;
