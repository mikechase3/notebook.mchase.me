# Early Life

## Characteristics

1. **Metabolism**: it turns food into energy and waste.
2. **Reproduction**
3. **Homeostasis:** living things can control an internal environment (body) relative to exterior events.

### Basic Groups

1. Eucaryotes
2. Archaea
3. Bacteria

### Evolution & Ecology

* Life is very diverse: Millions and millions of species live from the highest mountaintops to the deepest parts of the ocean basin.
* Chemically, life is simple
  * **Made up of:** carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen.
  * **Chemical Reactions:** Sulphur, phosphate
  * These elements are the most abundant in the universe.

### Origin of Life

* **Monomers:** compounds that use the above elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen) and form things that life is made out of: $$CH_4, NH_3, CO_2, H_2O$$
* **Polymers:** even more complex: glucose sugar, carbonic carbohydrates.
