## Flash Cards

* I placed these decks in the order we went over them in class below so you can study them individually.
* They're also grouped together in this [folder](https://quizlet.com/mikechase3/folders/rocks-for-jocks?x=1xqt&i=ss8s).
* Interludes are all lumped together in one deck. I know it's not ideal, so if you want to change that, get in contact with me and I'll help you login to make changes.
