# Astronomy

## Basic Definitions

* **Titus-Bode Rule**: Each plane is roughly twice as far from the sun as the proceeding planet.
* Atoms: the smallest particle that retains all of the given properties of an element.
* Elements: A substance that can't be broken into a simpler substanance by ordinary chemical or physical process. You can change elements with nuclear processes.
* Atomic Structure: protons/neutrons/electrons.

### 4 Fundamental Forces

| Fundamental Force | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| Nuclear Strong Force | Super strong, but only operates at a super small scale. |
| Nuclear Weak Force | Responsible for radioactive decay. |
| Electromagnetic Force | This binds electrons to the nucleus. It is not as strong as the nuclear forces, but operates at a much larger distance. This is how magnets work. |
| Gravity | The weakest attractive force between any two objects that have mass. It's the weakest force, but operates in an infinite distance. |

## Origin of the Universe

### Evidence

### Red Shift of Light & Doppler Effect

The faster a light source moves away from an observer, the more red they look. This scales to the Universe, so further away something gets away from earth, the more red it looks. By observing how planets are getting more red and which direction we can go, we can re-wind the tape to observe that everything started in one place.

### Big Bang Hypothesis

1. **Define Problem**: How did the univeerse originate?
2. **Collect Data & Make Observations**: The doppler effect shows that all galaxies are moving outward, away from earth and that the farther a galaxy is away, the faster it is moving.
3. **Formulate Hypothesis**: The universe began as an infinitely hot, dense, point of energy that explodes. Matter and space are created the universe expands and accelerates outwards.
4. **Test Hypothesis**: Collect more data. 
   1. Black body radiation left over from the big bang. Discovered andd fits predicted intensity curve.
   2. Primordial helium: scientists predicted that the big bang should've created approximately 75% hydrogen and 25% helium. But fusion in stars should create more helium. The older a star is, the more helium it should contain. Our sun has 28% helium. 
5. **Corroborate or Dispute Hypothesis:** A good theory, but people always refute it somehow.

## Life Cycle of a Star

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28545%29.png)

1. Stars burn hydrogen and convert it to helium.
2. The helium accumulates.
3. Gravitational contraction of core heats it up.
4. Helium begins to fuse into elements up to carbon.

### The Nebula Theory of Solar System Formation

I got distracted because the girl sitting next to me started drawing on a post-it note, so I made my own drawing. It was significantly less good than her's. I have little idea of what this is, so I should look it up later.

### Photosynthesis

$$
CO_2+H_2O \xrightarrow[\texttt{Energy}]{\texttt{Sun's}} C_6H_{12}O_6 +6O_2\texttt{ (aka Glucose)} + O_2
$$

* I'm not sure why he wrote Oxygen twice... must've missed something.

### Mercury

![Source: EarthHow](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28569%29.png)

* **Mercury**: Impacts caused **craters**. 
* Has no wind, water, or erosion which would destroy the craters.
* Meteors burn in earth's atmosphere, but not Mercury.
* Earth has plate active plate tectonics, particularly volcanism.
* The earth essentially recycles its surface material. Mercury by contrast doesn't have internal heat to do that, making mercury a _dead planet_ because it doesn't have an active heat engine like the earth does.
* The planet is cooling down and shrinking slowly.

### Venus

![Source: EarthHow](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28570%29.png)

* Similar in size to earth.
* The $$CO_2$$ makes up 96% of the atmosphere.
* Runaway greenhouse effect at $$900\degree F$$ at the surface.
* Rather than have sections or plates interacting with each other.
* The hottest planet in the solar system.

#### Phosphene & Fraudulent Claims

The more extraordinary the claim, the more evidence is required to support it. Phosphene signals that there might be life on Venus, but scientists disagree with that paper and the methods they used.

#### Venus's Volcanoes

Venus has volcanoes which form rhyolite which cause circular volcanoes.

### 

### Earth

* First photosynthetic life 3.8bn years ago.

#### Earth's Core

We can figure out what comes from the core through volcanoes and earthquakes. We also look at meteorites and analyze their composition because heir composition should similar to what's inside the earth.

* **Inner core**: made of iron
* **Outer core**: silicon, iron
* **Mantle**: Nobody has gotten into the mantle to collect a sample.



### Mars

![Source: Earth How](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28567%29.png)

* The atmosphere is thin and mostly composed of $$CO_2$$ 
* Red because of oxidized iron.There's a tiny bit of oxygen on mars.
* Contains polarized carbon dioxide ice.
* **Craters** tell us that Mars is a _dead_ planet with little/no internal heat.
* **Cracks**: Water was probably running on Mars at one point.
