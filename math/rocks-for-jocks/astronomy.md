# Astronomy

## Basic Definitions

* **Titus-Bode Rule**: Each plane is roughly twice as far from the sun as the proceeding planet.
* Atoms: the smallest particle that retains all of the given properties of an element.
* Elements: A substance that can't be broken into a simpler substanance by ordinary chemical or physical process. You can change elements with nuclear processes.
* Atomic Structure: protons/neutrons/electrons.

### 4 Fundamental Forces

| Fundamental Force | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| Nuclear Strong Force | Super strong, but only operates at a super small scale. |
| Nuclear Weak Force | Responsible for radioactive decay. |
| Electromagnetic Force | This binds electrons to the nucleus. It is not as strong as the nuclear forces, but operates at a much larger distance. This is how magnets work. |
| Gravity | The weakest attractive force between any two objects that have mass. It's the weakest force, but operates in an infinite distance. |

## Origin of the Universe

### Evidence

### Red Shift of Light & Doppler Effect

The faster a light source moves away from an observer, the more red they look. This scales to the Universe, so further away something gets away from earth, the more red it looks. By observing how planets are getting more red and which direction we can go, we can re-wind the tape to observe that everything started in one place.
