# Chapter 7: Sedimentary Rocks

## Why Study

* Covers 70% of earth's land surface.
* Economically important
  * Contain oil/gas deposits.
  * Important source of minerals.
* Retain information about how/why earth was formed and give clues to Earth's ancient environments.
* Contain fossils.

## Classes of Sedimentary Rocks

There are 4 major classes of sedimentary rocks: clastic, 

1. Clastic: rocks cemented together as clasts
2. Biochemical: consists of shells grown by organisms.
3. Organic: carbon-rich like from plants.
4. Chemical sedimentary rocks: minerals that precipitated directly from surface-water solutions.

## Clastic Sedimentary Rocks

* Weathering
* Erosion
* Transportation
* Deposition
* Lithification

#### Classification of Clastic Sedimentary Rocks

* Clast size
* Clast composition
* Angularity and sphericity
* Sorting
* Sedimentary maturity
* Character of cement

### Chemical Sedimentary Rocks

* **Limestone**: CaCo3. Composed of mineral calcite. There are several different varieties.
* **Dolostone:** composed of the mineral dolomite.
* **Chert**: microcrystalline quartz.
* **Evaporites:** halite, gypsum, annhydrite.
