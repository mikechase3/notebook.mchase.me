# Sedimentary Rocks

## Why Study

* Covers 70% of earth's land surface.
* Economically important
  * Contain oil/gas deposits.
  * Important source of minerals.
* Retain information about how/why earth was formed and give clues to Earth's ancient environments.
* Contain fossils.

## Classes of Sedimentary Rocks

There are 4 major classes of sedimentary rocks: clastic,&#x20;

1. Clastic: rocks cemented together as clasts
2. Biochemical: consists of shells grown by organisms.
3. Organic: carbon-rich like from plants.
4. Chemical sedimentary rocks: minerals that precipitated directly from surface-water solutions.

## Clastic Sedimentary Rocks

* Weathering
* Erosion
* Transportation
* Deposition
* Lithification

#### Classification of Clastic Sedimentary Rocks

* Clast size
* Clast composition
* Angularity and sphericity
* Sorting
* Sedimentary maturity
* Character of cement

### Chemical Sedimentary Rocks

* **Limestone**: CaCo3. Composed of mineral calcite. There are several different varieties.
* **Dolostone:** composed of the mineral dolomite.
* **Chert**: microcrystalline quartz.
* **Evaporites:** halite, gypsum, annhydrite.

### Interpreting Sedimentary Rocks

* **Transport History**:&#x20;
* **Sedimentary Structures**:&#x20;
* **Ripple Marks:** (see below)

### Defining Sedimentary Rocks

1. Size
2. Size distribution (sorting)
3. Shape
4. Mineralogy
5. White rock structures

## Sedimentary Structures

### Ripples

### Crossbeds

### Mud Cracks

### Graded Bedding

## Summary Uniformitarianism

* Color: Reds: _oxidized iron, red beds;_ Black: _unoxidized organics, swamp, deep marine_.
* Mineralogy
* Grain size
* Sorting (size distribution)
* Grain shape (roundness)
* Fossils
* Sedimentary structures: ripples, cross bedding, mud cracks.

You cannot observe all these characteristics in every rock.

### Story of Ancestral Rockies

1. There were mountains called the **ancestral rockies**
2. A red magma body came up 60 million years ago. Magma pushed up through these sediments.
3. In he modern-day rockies, the red pieces of sandstone are the remnants of ancestral rockies that weathered down and disappeared.
