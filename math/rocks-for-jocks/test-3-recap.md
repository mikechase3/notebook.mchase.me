# Test 3 Recap

## Test 3 Topics

* Plate tectonics
* Early evolution of earth
* Early evolution of life
* Evolution & natural selection

## Quick Recap

* Hadean (Oldest): We get the early atmosphere. There's some question about where water came from. Some scientists think they are&#x20;

### Archean Period

* Early CO2 rich atmosphere.
* Life is only protokaryotic cells
* Small steep sided continents
* Rapid tectonics with lots of volcanism
* Sedimentary deposits are immature, no road continental shelves&#x20;
* Branded Iron Formation. If you're going to transport iron, it can't be oxidized. It has to be oxidized in-place.

### Trace Fossils - 600 million years ago

* Tracefossils: first evidence of things going through sediment. Body has to make its way through it. So we think there's the development of organisms with bodies that are structured & tough enough so we start getting the first trace fossils.

## Origin of the Metazoa (Multicellular Animals)

### Cropper Hypothesis

Checkout the slides.

### Andy Knoll's Oxygen Threshold and Precambrian Rifting

* Organic matter
* In contact with the atmosphere
* Oxidizes. It's burnign.
* If we bury all this organic matter, it causes a spike in atmospheric oxygen.
* Some environmental threshold is crossed that allows metazoans to evolve. More complicagd organisms can evolve. In his hypothesis, plate tectonic process leads to environmental change, which presurefs evolutionary change all within a biochemical cycle.
* The only problem with the it is that we don't know what the oxygen threshold was or when it was crossed.&#x20;

### Last Hypothesis: Paul Hoffman: The Snowball Earth

* We talked about evidence for this snowball earth.
* You have a layer of Tillite (which is glacial sediment that has been turned into rock). There is a layer of something with cap-carbonates over it. This forms a fossil-record like record.&#x20;
* There's perhaps two things going on at once. There's the Tillite which is the snowball earth.
* The 2nd thing going on is the cap-carbonates which is a return to warm earth.

## The Burgess Shale Fauna (Middle Cambrian)

There's a famous story of the archbishop of Canturbury and the arch ishop says to this evolutionary biologist "you seem to understand so much about the history of life on earth, can you tell me anything about why God did...?" and he replied "God made thousand of species of eels, so God must've really like eels."

So how do we understand what life might have been like if it doesn't fossilize? Luckily, sometimes we get weird deposits which are exceptionally great deposits of b ody organisms. These get buried in low oxygen environments right before they start to erode becuase they're buried immediately.

There's this thing in the arcadian rockies that have unique organisms in these shale deposits.&#x20;

> Forlimbs and Third things and Anomalocaris are parts of the same organism.

* Trilobites
* Marilla
* Pikaia: a segmented word
* Aysheaia: some sort-of segmented worm type thing. There was a fossil & reconstructions. This is soft-body and wouldn't be preserved in an ordinary deposit.
* Hallucigena: looks like a pokemon.
* Wiwaxia: it ate bacterial mass and walked around.&#x20;
