# Steno & Early Geology

## Learning Goals

* Geologic time: earth's age gives us context for geologic processes and events.
* Plate tectonics: how it has helped us reconstruct the history of the earth.
* Evolution: understanding the development & history of life on earth.

### External Metaphors in Geologic Thought

* Is Geologic history directional or cyclical? When is it cyclical like mountains rising/falling? Or directional meaning humans will be extinct one day.
* Was earth shaped by gradual processes or catastrophic upheavals.
* How do earth and life relate? What is the relationship between major changes in physical and biological earth systems.

## Early Life

* Prokaryotes



## Figured Stones

We looked at stones and learned it was hard to determine if things were organic/inorganic by looking just at rocks.

## Early Geologists

### Thomas Burnet & the Sacred Theory of the Earth (1635-1715)

He explained that God works in ways that can be observed. It's a way to think of scriptural framework, but think how it's possible to describe God's work through observation.&#x20;

* Adam/Eve: perfection
* Noah/s Flood: ocean holes form.

### The Great Subterranean Ocean

Problems:

1. Where did the water come from?
2. Where does the water go?

Solution: _**the great subterranean ocean**_, this idea is that everything was an ocean and mountains got built-up afterwards?

### The Neptunist View of Rock Formation

#### Old ways of categorizing rocks

|              |                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Primary      | Igneous, metamorphic, metal ores      |
| Transitional | Metamorpized or deformed sedimentary. |
| Secondary    | Sedimentary rock, but no ores.        |
| Tertiary     | Unconsolidated sediments              |

#### Problems of Neptunist View

* Where all the water went was ever explained. The origin of basalt and volcanoes was theory was incorrect. They assumed all volcanoes were recent.z

### Genognosy Theory

1. The world is initially covered by a universal ocean.
2. Out of the ocean, primitive rocks are precipitated right onto the earth's irregular core.
3. Crystallization of so much material causes ocean to recede and transitional rocks are precipitated in inclined layers. These two units are universal.
4. Further sea-levels drop and erosion of universal rock units cause the secondary rocks (sandstones, limestone, evaporites, coal, and basalt) to form locally.
5. Finally ocean recedes to today's levels and non marine strata, Alluvium (river gravels), form.

### The Plutonists & James Hutton Theory (1785)

They were usually wealthy people who didn't have to work. James Hutton was a geologist in 1785 and he was trying to understand how to explain the layers of rock that he found in his corn fields, particularly, the gravel of rocks?

He tried to figure out what are the steps for making a sequences like this. How do you do that? Here's an incorrect explanation:





## Early Controversies

He wrote this all on the board...

| Basalt is a sedimentary rock | Coal seems ignited on fire and the burning suberrinian coal so that it would melt and come out of a volcano.  |
