## Sedimentary Rocks

#### Energy Sources associated with Sedimentary Rocks

* Sandstone and limestone make up patroleum which causes 70% of our earth.
* 20% uses coal
* Uranium is 5%.

#### Definition

* A rock formed from the from the products of weathering.
* **Weathering**: any process by rocks are ripped apart/decomposed
  * **Physical**: freeze/thaw cycle where rocks are ripped apart or frost-wedging.
  * **Chemical** Weathering: oxidation and carbonation \(co2\)
    * Oxidation process: once the oxygen is dissolved in water, it becomes a good oxidizing agent. Water is dissolved with oxygen. Ferromagnesian silicate materials turn into iron oxide. 
    * CO2 is very water soluble. CO2 mixes with water in the atmosphere and makes carbonic acid. Carbonic acid attacks everything but olive and quartz.
      * The \#1 product of chemicals reactions are clay minerals?
  * Major solid products of weathering: Clay minerals, quartz, iron oxide
  * Dissolved products: soluble bicarbonates and silica \(silic acid; a very weak acid that is carried off to the ocean\).
  * These dissolved products make sedimentary rocks.

70% of sedimentary rocks are shales.

### Clastic and Non-Clastic

* **Clastic**: Form from solid products of weathering
* **Non-Clastic**: forms from non-solid products of weathering. These are rocks that started in solution and were made out of solution.

#### Kinds of Non-ClasticSedimentary Rocks

* Chemical: changing the physical properties or chemical properties or both.
* Biochemical: the bio implies that there's a plant/animal involved.
  * Example: clams leave shells which turn into limestone.
  * We know this because of fossils.
* Evaporate: there are certain materials that go into the solution that don't want to come out. 

  * Sulfite for example doesn't want to come out. 
  * Halite is another good example. Salt also doesn't precipitate out of the solution and you have to remove the solution to get the salt out.
