# Building the Geologic Timescale

**5) Building the Geologic Timescale**

Ø  Relative Dating - Placing rocks and geological events in proper ordered sequence. We decide what happened first, then second, and so on. The exact chronological age of each event is not determined.

i) Nicolas Steno (1669):

a)     Principle of Superposition - In an undeformed sequence of layered rocks, each layer is older than the one above it and younger than the one below it.

b)     Principle of Original Horizontality - Layers of sedimentary rocks were originally laid down in a horizontal position. Any folding, tilting or overturning must have occurred _after_ deposition.

&#x20;        ii) James Hutton (1785):

c)     Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships - Layers of strata are older than any fault or igneous intrusion that cross-cuts them.

&#x20;        iii) Unconformities - If sedimentary layers are laid down continuously without interruption, the sequence

&#x20;is called conformable. Usually, however, there will be periods of time when either no rocks are  deposited or erosion takes place. This leaves “gaps” or periods of time for which there is no rock record.

a)     Angular unconformity - Tilted or folded sedimentary layers are overlain by flat lying layers. Easy to see.

b)     Disconformity -  A gap between parallel layers of sedimentary rocks. More difficult to see.

c)     Non-conformity - contact between older igneous or metamorphic rocks and overlying sedimentary rocks.

&#x20;

&#x20;  iv) William Smith (1796): A British mining engineer who demonstrated that fossil organisms can be used

&#x20;  to order rocks.

a)     Principle of Faunal Succession - Fossil faunas succeed one another in a definite and determinable order. Each time period can be recognized by its own unique assemblage of fossils.

b)     Therefore, we can use fossils to locate unconformities (missing faunas) and to show time equivalence between rocks in different geographic locations (same fossil fauna, same age).

&#x20;

Ø  Absolute Dating - The practice of assigning an actual date to rocks and events. This became possible when scientists learned to use radioactive elements as clocks. We call this technique **radiometric dating**.

&#x20;

&#x20;        Each element on Earth may occur in several different “species” or varieties. These varieties are called **isotopes** and differ from one another by the number of neutrons contained in their respective nuclei. Thus, Uranium238 has 3 more neutrons in its nucleus than does Uranium 235. Some isotopes are inherently unstable and breakdown spontaneously to more stable elements. These isotopes that spontaneously breakdown are called radioactive. The isotope breaking down is called the parent element, and the isotope being produced is called the daughter element. The process is called radioactive decay.

How can we use this process to date rocks?

&#x20;        Radioactive decay occurs at a constant rate that **does not change** under the physical conditions found at or near the Earth’s surface. Radioactive elements in a rock begin to decay as soon as the rock forms (cools), and continue to decay at a constant rate that can be experimentally measured. These rates are known for many radioactive elements, and are used to calculate a value called the half-life. **The half-life is the amount of time it takes for one half of the original parent amount to decay to the daughter product**. The half-life is different for each element.
