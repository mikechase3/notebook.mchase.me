# Earth Minerals

## Goals

* Understanding what minerals are made of
* How to atoms interact with each other?

## Overview

* A **mineral** is a naturally occurring, inorganic \(not composed of Carbon-Hydrogen molecules usually part of living tissue\), solid crystalline \(atoms have a structured arrangement; opposite of amorphous\),  substance with definite physical and chemical properties. 

## Chemistry Review

* Atoms want to be stable, not neutral.
* **Stable**: means having their outer shell of electrons at full capacity.
* This can happen by losing/gaining electrons to other atoms.
* This process causes atoms to join together: a process called _bonding_.
