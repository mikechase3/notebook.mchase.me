# Earth Minerals

## Goals

* Understanding what minerals are made of
* How to atoms interact with each other?

## Overview

* A **mineral** is a naturally occurring, inorganic \(not composed of Carbon-Hydrogen molecules usually part of living tissue\), solid crystalline \(atoms have a structured arrangement; opposite of amorphous\),  substance with definite physical and chemical properties. 

## Chemistry Review

* Atoms want to be stable, not neutral.
* **Stable**: means having their outer shell of electrons at full capacity.
* This can happen by losing/gaining electrons to other atoms.
* This process causes atoms to join together: a process called _bonding_.

### Ionic Bonding

| Bond Type | Explanation | Strength | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ionic | Atoms lose or gain electrons to/from other atoms | Strong | NaCl-Haloite |
| Covalent | Atoms share 1 or more electrons | Very Strong | Carbon-diamond; chlorine gas. |
|  |  |  |  |
| Metalic | Electrons act as mobile clouds moving from atom to atom. | Variable | Copper & Silver |
