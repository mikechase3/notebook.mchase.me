# Continents

## 3.2 Evidence of Drift

* Rock structures/mountains indicate it was all put together.
  * Appalachian mountains.
* Fit of the continents.

#### The fit of the continents

* **Tidal Forces**: gravitational pull of the moon and sun. (Moon/earth gravity).
* **Centrifugal force:** of Earth's Rotation: this was proposed, but proven wrong somehow.
* Sir Harold Jefferies: he noted that these forces are too weak to pull a continent across the ocean floor.

* Imagine we have a rock and compress it. We apply a _stress_ to the rock when we do
* We apply a force, stress the rock, and it accumulates the rock by deforming the shape.
* At some point, it can't take it anymore, so it breaks.
