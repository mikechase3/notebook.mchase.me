## Identifying Rocks

### Color

* Minerals can have different colors. Quartz can be in amathest.

### Diapheniety

* Can light pass through it?/
* Is it distorted or cloudy \(translucent\)?
* Is it opaque? Can light not pass through the material?

### Streak

* The color of the powder or mineral.
* The streak can be quite different than its color.

### Luster

* Metallic or non-metallic.

### Non-metallic Lusters

* Virtuous: Shine when turned in the light.
* Dull/Flat: Does not shine or glisten when turned in the light.

### Hardness

* Measure of the strength of the material.
* We use the _Moore's hardness scale_ for the test.
  * Glass plate: 5.5
  * Penny: 3.5
  * Fingernail: 2.5.

### Fracture/Cleavages

* If a mineral breaks, and it has a clean, flat side, then it has cleavage.
* Shape: flat clevage in one direction? Flat clevage in 2 directions? Clevage in 3 directions?

### Miscellaneous

* Magnetic
* Distinctive taste.
* Reactions with acids. See if minerals dissolve in it.
