#### Take Home

* Ex 4.40: Section 7, absolute maximum/minimum where the domain is a closed & bounded region.
  * The theorem says it's going to have an absolute maximum and minimum.
  * It's rather cumbersome and will take a while to go through. 
* Ex 4.42: finding a maximum or minimum on a constraint.
  * The constraint will be a subset of a curve.
  * He mentioned "Lagrange multipliers"
