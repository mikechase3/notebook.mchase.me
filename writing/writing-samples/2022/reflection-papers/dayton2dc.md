Some words about this.

#### Credibility

* Credibility:&#x20;

####

#### Thesis

* **Option 1:** My career ambitions changed as a direct result of how much bullcrap students have to go through. Now, I'm going to stay in dayton because the quality of life is much better.

#### Preview

How this gonna go down.



\---

* Set expectations before the reading/experience
* **Thesis:**&#x20;
  * Green flags, but high cost of living and stressful work environments is what I worked my butt off to avoid.&#x20;
  * Moving to DC isn't as big of a move-up as I thought.
  * In a position to choose what I want to do.



### _Subjective_ Ambitions Before Trip

#### Business & Entrepreneurship

* Using little principal.
* Became Computer Science so I could do that.

#### Communicate/Educate Congressmen&#x20;

* Mark Zukerberg confusing the heck out of our legislators.
* I'll have a mock-litigation and pretend to be Mark Zukerberg to make sure they're asking the right questions.

#### MORE POWER within the Air Force

* I wanted a wider view like the pentagon.
* There are things called "enterprise functions"
* I'll have to check those out!
* I knew it wasn't going to be more power = more pay. I didn't know it would be so bad.

#### Get me to the top now

* Delayed Gratification
* Philanthropy is easier with 100K in hand.

### Others' _Objective_ DC Experiences

#### Red Flags

* Letters of recommendation
* Applying to 70ish places?
  * Hire someone to do it for me?

#### Green Flags

* Achievement
* Administration & business management
* Wide views in Administration & business management.
* Stereotypes were challenged: alumni and panelists were nicer/receptive than I expected

### What I subjectively believe now

* What are the effects on how I think?
* What are the effects on how I'll act & what I'll do?

#### Family Obligations & Time Management

Not a good fit for me

1. Fails to achieve creative sides (piano, logic)
2. Doesn't meet personal goals (to start entreprenuership/family and paying the bills).

#### Career Switch Will Come Naturally Within Air Force

When I'm ready to go there, it'll happen a bit more naturally.



### Conclusion

* **Significance Changes**:&#x20;
  * **Tradeoffs**: power comes w/ a cost.
* Future
  * Stay in Dayton
  * Might go there later.
* Recommend
  * I'm a bad fit.
  * Extraverts - go for it.
* Thanks for everything!
