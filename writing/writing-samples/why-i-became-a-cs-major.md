## Recording Life

I cared so much about my education. Almost weirdly "goody-two-shoes." Almost feel ripped-off because it has diminishing marginal returns and people got degrees and better grades with far less effort than me.

* OneNote
* Notability
* Samsung Galaxy Note
* Google Docs, Chromebook
* Writing stylus pieces of crap for IOS Notes
* Piece of crap iOS notes. Then pen but still crappy iOS notes though it's much better now. Now crappy actually, just not outstanding.
* Several websites
* Google Site documenting everything
* Excel workbooks & timelines
* Web apps that were visual aids/timelines.
* Love thepudding.io's visual essays.
* Collections of photos, record keeping.
* Loved the dewey decimal system.
* Lighting director, we had to use computer science concepts, but design them ourselves. Arrays were channels when programming them. Same with addresses; some lights would use many addresses if the had different functions because the underlying storage was an 8-bit dip switch on the light oftentimes which controlled how many addresses it was listening on yada yada yada it was a good segway into what I'm doing now.
* I could go on about cameras, getting into trouble for trying to secretly-record high-school theology class.

## Snap Circuits

* Loved recognizing and applying patterns.
* Wish and hope my brain continues to develop and doesn't "stop" learning, though I hear that happens when you hit adulthood.&#x20;
* But I loved learning back then, and I still love learning now.
* I just never had enough space to use these toys. I needed a laboratory (and should've tried to buy one before housing prices skyrocketed)
