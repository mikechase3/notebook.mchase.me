# Thesis Ideas 2024 Reflections

Hello anyone willing to read my ideas. I'm working for the Air Force's Gaming Research Integration for Learning Laboratory & attending school at the University of Dayton. Here are some initial thoughts for my thesis/projects:

### The place for AI in VR training: What ways do we envision AI can be used to rapidly develop or change the way VR training is made or given (emerging tech)

Pathfinding algorithms have plugins.&#x20;

### Video Games & Biological Effects?&#x20;

Decision making in humans during uncertainty, stress, and fatigue.&#x20;

Applications by our biomedical division in collaboration with Columbia Engineering.&#x20;

* Pilot-induced Oscillations
* Driving in fog & slick driving conditions.
* Navigating spacecraft under stress & fatigue.&#x20;
