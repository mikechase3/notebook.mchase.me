Obviously, these templates are a guide only â€“ because of their nature, they have to be made generic and do not cater for every situation. Businesses using the templates will need to consult their lawyer to ensure that their use of these documents is appropriate to their situation. They are designed for New Zealand companies but are easily adaptable for use in other common wealth countries.
