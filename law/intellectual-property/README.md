* **Utility patents**: most common. Using or making something like machinery or pharmaceuticals.&#x20;
* **Design Patents:** pharmaceuticals. There are more things than a tire tread. An example would be the Febreze design patent. It has the monk look, the angled top, the curved handle. The design patents prevent knock-offs and look-alikes.&#x20;
* **Plant Patents:** Produces&#x20;
* Protection lasts for 20 years from the date of filing.&#x20;

### Requirements for Patents

* **New**: Must not have been invented/sold anywhere in the world.&#x20;
* **Non-Obvious**: self-explanatory. Let's say we're combine the best paint job & best engines & everyone will love it, is that obvious or would only a skilled person be able to come up with that idea?
* **Process, Machine, Manufacture, or Composition of Matter**: whatever

### Authority

It comes from the **constitution** to promote the progress of science and the useful awrts by securing for limited times to authors & inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings & discoveries. Article 1 section 8.&#x20;

### Air Force Patent Process

1. Inventor completes SF 1279 and 1981
2. It get approved by inventor's lab
3. Air Force Atty Triages Forms 1279 and 1981

* Make sure to include the summary & information for lawyers to write-up. &#x20;

### Elements and Limitations

1. **Elements**: the parts of the invention
2. **Limitations**: how the parts fit together & work together.

### Patent Value

* Own the **benefit**.&#x20;
* Cover all the avenues to the benefit when filing.&#x20;
* Make invalidation difficult.

### The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure

1. Do your research. A patentable invention must be new & non-obvious. Explore non-patent literature: professional journals, google scholar.&#x20;
2. Look for unexpected results. What technical results/advantage would not have been predicted by your knowledgeable colleagues?

## Agreements

In the Air Force, we can't be seen as a government entity and can't show any favoritism. We have to be scrupulous and there'd be lots of changes we'd like to see; however, we cannot take those as worthwhile as they may be.&#x20;
