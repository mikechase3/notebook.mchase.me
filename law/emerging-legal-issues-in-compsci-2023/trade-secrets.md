## Economic Espionage Act (EEA)

* The Economic espionage act of 1996
* Includes foreign governments
* Enacted in response to the fear that the US couldn't maintain its industrial and economic edge or safeguard national security
* There was a chemist who worked for Coca-Cola and had access to the BPA-free Coca-Cola thing.
* She gave it to the government of China. She was imprisoned for 14 years, but released after 3 years of fines.

### Defense of Derress

* The DOJ was incredible interested in making an example out of that individual.
* It's not so much protecting Coca-Cola, but rather the interests of the US economy.

### Judgement Proof

* You basically get a piece of paper that says "this person owes me money"
* But they don't have money.

### Collecting

#### Wage Garnishment

* The state typically has a maximum (e.g. 10% on $50K)
* Depending on how much money the person is making, it could be zero because they need a min standard of living.

#### Foreclosure

* Grab their car
  * You usually pay most of the interest first on a loan.
* Grab their house.
  * Most states will protect the house unless there's a large amount of equity. ($125K in Ohio)
  * If you have a house & no loan on it, nobody is allowed to forclose on your house.
