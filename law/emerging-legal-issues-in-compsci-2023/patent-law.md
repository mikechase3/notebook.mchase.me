# Patent Law

## Comparing to Copyright

**Patents are:**

1. **Shorter**: only lasts 20yrs in the US.&#x20;

### What can be patented

1. **Processes**: protect methods of doing things.
2. **Machine**
3. **Manufacture**
4. Composition of Matter

**Example: 1-Click Shopping**: a business method patent allowing customers to purchase an item with one-click.&#x20;

#### Not Patentable

1. Laws of nature, physical phenomena, or abstract ideas
2. An abstract idea must be reduced to an invention
3. Literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works
4. Offensive to the public morality (illegal)

## Software

* Software must be more than an **abstract idea**.
* The software must do more than be only an improvement to a method of performing a business task. Aka, it can't be an improvement on a business task.&#x20;

### Abstract Idea Definition

Is the claim directed to an abstract idea? If I design code where a computer plays chess, can I patent that? No because this software merely implements an abstract idea such as a fundamental economic process, a method of organizing human activity, etc.

* **Examples**: bleh
* **Non Examples:** software isolating & removing malicious code from electronic messages (e.g. email) to prevent a computer from being compromised, for example by being infected with a computer virus.&#x20;

## Blocking Patents

* Deals more with physical stuff.
* It blocks you from further moving your invention along by things you'd naturally want that invention to include.
* You pretty much don't find these in software code. You have to file a description for what it is.  You have to show drawings specific enough of how to create the machine and then you'd have to explain & engineer it.&#x20;
* **Pencil Example**: someone made a pencil. Then someone else made a pencil with an eraser on the end, but because they went through a non-obvious new useful thing, they were able to create the patent. Then, it was sold to $100,000 to the person who owned the pencil.

## Novelty

Patents must be new or novel. The patent office will look at:

1. Is it in public use by another entity?
2. On sale in the US?
3. On sale in another country? (A bit flexible)

## Obviousness

This is rough. You have to get it through patent attorneys in the patent office and it's going to be up to the person reviewing it if it was _obvious_.&#x20;

The general standard is to ask if it would be obvious to a person with an ordinary skill.

#### Elements:

1. Combining prior elements to yield predictable results?
2. Simple substitution?
3. Use of known technique to improve similar device
4. Apply a known technique to a known device
5. Obvious to try & predictable solution?
6. One more...

## Other types of Patents

1. **Utility Patents**: granted to inventions that represent new things.&#x20;
2. **Design Patents**:&#x20;
