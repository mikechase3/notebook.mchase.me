## Regulation&#x20;

### Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 18 USC 1030

Criminal law is fulfilled if:

1. You've got a computer.
2. You accessed it.
3. You went beyond authorization.

Boom - that's it.

* **Without authorization**: is a very broad term. It's a heavily criticized law because it's so easy to break this law by accident.&#x20;

### Sharing of Academic Journals

In United States of America v. Araon Swartz, Aron took 30 papers in Harvard & put them on the internet without authorization. As a student, he was authorized to access them, but it was above his authorization to put them on the internet. This violated the CFAA (computer, fraud, and abuse act). Because it was 30 papers, he had 30 or so counts of charges.

Harvard was quite mad. They weren't offering him a plea deal during the process of the trial. The day before, he committed suicide because he thought he was going to go to federal jail for a minimum of 30 years. He really hadn't done that much.
