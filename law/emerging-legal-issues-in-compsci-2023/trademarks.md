# Trademarks

## Lecture
* Trademarks protect your identifiers.
* Trademarks are usually country-wide.
  * You can get state patents & trademarks.
  * Federal trumps state trademarks.
  * You have to file in each country.
* **Squatting:** it's usually void & overruled.
* Trademarks last **10 years** and are renewable every 10 years (infinitely).

## Types of Markings
What can you get a trademark on? What can you not?

### Weak Marks

**Generic Terms**
* If you name it "hotels.com" and the website lets you book a website, that's weak.
* It's almost impossible to trademark that. 
  * You have to be so potent that everyone knows that hotels.com refers to this website.

**Descriptive Markings**
* A description of what it is:
* It's hard to protect.
* Required to acquire a **second meaning**.

### Distinctive Marks
* **Suggestive Mark**: (e.g. greyhound bus)
  * Does not immediately describe it & requires some mental exercise.
  * Provides **medium** protection.
* **Arbitrary Mark** (e.g. Apple Computers): a common word applied to an unfamiliar product
  * Unfortunately, you have to show your audience what it is.
* **Fanciful Mark** (e.g. Honda): Invented terms without meaning. 

## Infringement
* Confusing Similarity
* Descriptiveness: describing or generic term

### Plantiff Must Prove
1. Valid trademark
2. Defendant must've used the mark
3. Must be for/in commercse
4. For sale or advertisement.

It should be confusing fror the customer.

### Fun Examples
* Eric Corley owned "2600 enterprises" called fuckgeneralmotors.com
  * He didn't like what GM was doing to its employees.
  * He wanted to raise awareness & being critical.
  * **Fair**: they're not selling the same things and there wasn't actual confusion. He wasn't selling cars.
* **Infringement**: eBay wasn't infringing even though Tiffany fakes were doing some false advertising.
* **Parody**: a defense.
  * Tom Forsyte was taking pics of barbie dolls and critiquing the objectification of women.
  * Matel sued it for abusing their intellectual product & dress and using it to make money.
* **Treble Damages**: becauuse he won, they probably claimed they were deleuting his work & have to pay triple damages.

### Dept of Justice
* Craine was investigating
* He listed there was 150 tons of scrap metal in his basement.
* He purchased a bunch of nordic tracks like Peletons that were knockoffs. They were selling them.
* They mortgaged their house & credit cards and then got sued for infringement by Peleton.
  * They enabled them to win that case.
  * The knockoff Peletons were different.
  * They won
