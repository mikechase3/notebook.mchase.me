## Categories of Law

**What's preventing my teacher from stealing my laptop?** Professor Craine broke it down into four things:

1. **Ethics**: morals/values that guide individuals to make decisions. (E.g. ACM)
2. **Norms**: societal expectations.
3. **Morals**: personal standards of what is & not acceptable to do.

## Possible Futures of the Internet

How we shape law determines how the internet is potentially shaped:

1. **Dystopian/Pessimistic**: Dangerous & broken future (Dystopian & Pessimistic)
2. **Realist**: uneven & unequal future
3. **Utopian**: future is amazing & all good things.

### Reading: Are we Already Living in a Tech Dystopia

Assigned as a pre-reading, this article&#x20;

Defines dystopia and asks if we're living in one.

#### Zittrain's Comments

1. Establishes technology is used against us with the deception of "helping" us.&#x20;
2. Technologies are pervasive and companies are using it unethically to spy on us.
3. Worries that tech is too powerful because there's no licensing for engineers.

#### Wark's Comments

1. Dystopia implies extremism rather than a range, but we're not experiencing total domination or anything extreme so calling it a dystopia is an overstatement.&#x20;
2. Technology was once useful for the common good, but now it's used to make rich people richer.
3. Technology should support the common good but instead parties are using it selfishless to gain power.

#### Gidari's Comments

1. Technology is here to stay and it'll have negative externalities, but it'll motivate society to extend benefits to all.
2. Tech isn't good or evil.

### Video: Future of Technology Internet of Everything

There's pros & cons of tech in everyday life. If used for good, it increases efficiency. If used for bad, it can be used to control populations inorganically.&#x20;

## Video: On Tech Lawyers

* This bonus segment explains that lawyers don't have to know much code, but rather how it is used & how it functions/performs.
* For example, copying code is a copyright infringement but writing code that performs the same functionality as a proprietary software isn't illegal as long as the codebase wasn't stolen.

## Reading: Assault Tort de S et ux. v. W de S

Professor assigned us a reading. There was too much legal jargon and I was like who is `I` and what does he have to do with `S` and I'm going to need a crash course because `W` is still part of `S`. Also `de` isn't a word in the English language so that's probably latin so I'm excited to learn some of that too!

Anyways, he gave us a variation and I'll write a parody that'll get me in trouble sometime later. Let's say I'm an attorney sometime in the future and a white racist husband/wife client come to me and say that some black guy almost swung a hatchet at her. They accuse the black guy of manslaughterer because there's a black person in their neighborhood and they freak out or whatever so the cops come & I get their side of the story. The black guy told the cops that he was buying wine because it said, "wine for sale." All he did was knock the door and the wife was the one who had her head out the window and the black dude just had a hatchet with him because it's 1348 and pocketknives weren't around yet so why not carry around a hatchett without a case because that looks pretty sus dude. Racism aside, the black guy shouldn't just have the hatchet out anyways so I can see where she's coming from and why they're accusing him of potentially murder when he moved and 'swung' at her.

Disclaimer: I'm applying racial theories to 1348 logic. I regret that now because that has nothing to do with this case. It's about motive & physical damage evidence precedent.

So anyways, this goes to court and this is a common law case brought upon by the government. There was a jury and they "inquested" the situation and thought that if there's a sign that says "wine for sale" he should be able to buy it. Just because he had a hatchet out doesn't make him a murderer. He swung it at the girl, but just once and nothing bad happened.&#x20;

Or was it assault and he went to jail? Yeah, now that I googled it & found it online I see what's important about this case now.&#x20;

## Legal Foundations

We had a reading & he's going over it in class. This is some dry reading, but it explains how the law works by providing foundations of the lgal system. I didn't read it.

### 1.1 Purpose and Principles of Law

* **Purpose**: establish standards, maintain order, resolve disputes, protect rights/liberties.
  * Law means justice, morality, reason, order, righteous from the perspective of society.
  * Law means statues, acts, rules, regulations, orders, and ordinances from the point of view of the legislature.
  * Law means rules of court, decrees, judgement, order of courts, and injunction from judges viewpoint.
* **Injunctions** are when judges tell you what you can & cannot do.

### 1.1.1 Salmond & Classifications of Law

Salmond recognizes 8 types of laws: imperative, physical/scientific, natural/moral laws, conventional laws, customary laws, practical/technical laws, international law (btw nations), and civil law (enforced by state).

{% hint style="info" %}
Question: What are the 7 types of law?
{% endhint %}

* **Imperative Law**: asks us why we obey the law. We do it out of fear of the person in power. We follow & respect that due to the power of the position. This is the oldest form of law.
* **Physical/Scientific Law:** Laws of science. Don't question it's just science.
* **Natural or Moral Law**: Natural is based on principles of right & wrong, while moral laws are based on principles of morality. It can be derived from principles of right & wrong. It was originally guided by religion.
* **Customary Law**: the way you behave develops customs. Customs are written down. Then it becomes law.
* **Practical or Technical Law**: how does the law form out of technology?
  * Before the printing press, there was no copyright law. Once the press was there, publishers were making money off of others' labor.
* **International Laws**: don't try to mess with other world nations' legal systems.
* **Civil Law**: law enforced by the state.

#### Other Considerations

* Norms: unwritten
* Ethics: not criminal law, not civil law, but a regulated behavior.
* **Personal Morals**: most ethics say ethics create morals.&#x20;
* **Jurisprudence**: legal theory consisting of the theoretical study or konwledge of law.
* **Soverginty**: you can't sue the government unless they say you can.
* **Analytical Jurisprudence**: REVIEW

#### Code of Ethics for ACM

* It's a huge list of ethical principles. The GDPR tries to guide privacy, but also ACM.
* We can write about this on our paper.

### Legal Positivism



* **Legal Positivism**: the law springs from individuals with knowledge like philosophers, attorneys, judges. Because they've been schooled in the law, we should follow the social construction that they created. It's a top-down approach out of respect for philosophers & laws of nature as created.
* Tells us the law has little with morality & we should just apply the law as it is & move on.
* Just trust the legal system & let it work. It's like a science & we don't question science.

### Legal Realism

* Legal realism says we should look & question society to examine the outcome of the law.
* Asks if outcome does it serve good public policy & social interest.

### Normative Jurisprudence

That's concerned with evaluative theories of law.&#x20;



### Sources of Law

1. Legistlation & statutory law.
2. Legal precedent, case law, and history.
3. Sources of influence like elected officials.
4. Common Law **Stare Decisis** (Stare Decisis: term for whatever the previous courts did, you do that).
5. Civil Law: codified core principles
