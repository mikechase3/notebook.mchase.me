## Categories of Law

**What's preventing my teacher from stealing my laptop?** Professor Craine broke it down into four things:

1. **Ethics**: morals/values that guide individuals to make decisions. (E.g. ACM)
2. **Norms**: societal expectations.
3. **Morals**: personal standards of what is & not acceptable to do.

## Possible Futures of the Internet

How we shape law determines how the internet is potentially shaped:

1. **Dystopian/Pessimistic**: Dangerous & broken future (Dystopian & Pessimistic)
2. **Realist**: uneven & unequal future
3. **Utopian**: future is amazing & all good things.

### Reading: Are we Already Living in a Tech Dystopia

Assigned as a pre-reading, this article&#x20;

Defines dystopia and asks if we're living in one.

#### Zittrain's Comments

1. Establishes technology is used against us with the deception of "helping" us.&#x20;
2. Technologies are pervasive and companies are using it unethically to spy on us.
3. Worries that tech is too powerful because there's no licensing for engineers.

#### Wark's Comments

1. Dystopia implies extremism rather than a range, but we're not experiencing total domination or anything extreme so calling it a dystopia is an overstatement.&#x20;
2. Technology was once useful for the common good, but now it's used to make rich people richer.
3. Technology should support the common good but instead parties are using it selfishless to gain power.

#### Gidari's Comments

1. Technology is here to stay and it'll have negative externalities, but it'll motivate society to extend benefits to all.
2. Tech isn't good or evil.

### Video: Future of Technology Internet of Everything

There's pros & cons of tech in everyday life. If used for good, it increases efficiency. If used for bad, it can be used to control populations inorganically.&#x20;

## Video: On Tech Lawyers

* This bonus segment explains that lawyers don't have to know much code, but rather how it is used & how it functions/performs.
* For example, copying code is a copyright infringement but writing code that performs the same functionality as a proprietary software isn't illegal as long as the codebase wasn't stolen.

## Reading: Assault Tort de S et ux. v. W de S

Professor assigned us a reading. There was too much legal jargon and I was like who is `I` and what does he have to do with `S` and I'm going to need a crash course because `W` is still part of `S`. Also `de` isn't a word in the English language so that's probably latin so I'm excited to learn some of that too!

Anyways, he gave us a variation and I'll write a parody that'll get me in trouble sometime later. Let's say I'm an attorney sometime in the future and a white racist husband/wife client come to me and say that some black guy almost swung a hatchet at her. They accuse the black guy of manslaughterer because there's a black person in their neighborhood and they freak out or whatever so the cops come & I get their side of the story. The black guy told the cops that he was buying wine because it said, "wine for sale." All he did was knock the door and the wife was the one who had her head out the window and the black dude just had a hatchet with him because it's 1348 and pocketknives weren't around yet so why not carry around a hatchett without a case because that looks pretty sus dude. Racism aside, the black guy shouldn't just have the hatchet out anyways so I can see where she's coming from and why they're accusing him of potentially murder when he moved and 'swung' at her.

Disclaimer: I'm applying racial theories to 1348 logic. I regret that now because that has nothing to do with this case. It's about motive & physical damage evidence precedent.

So anyways, this goes to court and this is a common law case brought upon by the government. There was a jury and they "inquested" the situation and thought that if there's a sign that says "wine for sale" he should be able to buy it. Just because he had a hatchet out doesn't make him a murderer. He swung it at the girl, but just once and nothing bad happened.&#x20;

Or was it assault and he went to jail? Yeah, now that I googled it & found it online I see what's important about this case now.&#x20;
