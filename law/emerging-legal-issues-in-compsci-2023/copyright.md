# Copyright

## Types of Property

Copyright wasn't really invented until the Gutenberg Press came out and they could reproduce work. Once the press was invented, there were changes to the law.

* **Property** is coming you own.&#x20;
* **Real Property**: is land, buildings, things that are affixed.
* **Easements**: a right to use real property, such as utility right of way, or a shared driveway.
* **Personal Property**: cars, jewelry, clothing.
* **Intellectual Property**: copyrights trademarks, patents, trade secrets.

### Intellectual Property Details

* A property right that involves originality & imagination. Often referred to as _creations of the mind._
* **Monopoly**: it incentives people to create. If you couldn't copyright & sell it, you wouldn't engage in the creation. If anyone could buy & sell Microsoft's code, they wouldn't bother spending time & making money.

### **Copyrights**

* They last about 75-90 years and are one of the longest forms of legal protection.
* It only protects a tangible form of expression and not the subject matter of the work.
* Needs to be an original form of authorship fixed in a tangible medium.
* **Examples**: original literacy, dramas, musicals, artistic works, poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, architecture.
* **Does not protect**: facts, ideas, systems, methods of operations. (Exception: may protect the way these things are expressed).

## Who Owns Copyright?

Nuerto the Monkey

There was a monkey and they are so skiddish & shy. They'll watch humans from a distance. This photographer from England traveled out and wanted to take pictures of these particular monkeys as a part of his series. He noticed that the monkeys are naturally curious when humans aren't around, so he set up his camera such that the monkey would look at the equipment and take pictures. So this guy took a selfie of himself with a camera and there was a series of selfie photos and this exploded. The dude made a pretty decent amount of money, but eventually what happened was other people were using his photos in memes, etc.&#x20;

Then, we had a copyright fight, but it came out that he didn't take the photos but the monkey did. Then, the supreme court found that **monkeys cannot have claims** and he didn't literally click the picture.



## Sweat of the Brow & Modicum of Creativity

* It's too easy to hold up the camera & take the picture
* The Supreme Court said that photos, while easy to make, are easy to create; however, companies do not want people copyrighting their photos.
* Now, we require **at least a modicum** of creativity.&#x20;

### First Publication Inc v. Rural Telephone Service Co.

Some company spent a lot of effort compiling peoples' phone number into a book. They sent people to go collect lots of peoples' numbers. But then - another phone book company copied and then placed their own advertisements into it.&#x20;

The supreme court is shown the question: compiled data with names/addresses/photos. Can you copyright that? The supreme court said no, it's a fact that so & so lives in this address with this phone number. Therefore, you can't copyright facts.

The Supreme Court said no, while there was **sweat of the brow**, it can't be protected with copyright. In the US, we can let them copyright the whole presentation medium with fonts, how it's presented, etc.

### Cookbooks

* You can't copyright the recipe.
* You can copyright the description though.

### Burlington Home Shopping v Rajnish Chibber

* Rejnish worked for them, but the company had their own mailing list.
* Rejnish used the list & marketed to his customers.

### Website

* Websites with original content is automatically protected by copyright.&#x20;

### Softwrae

* Software is a protected medium as soon as it enters a copyrightable medium.
* Source & object code is copyrightable. You can protect it through a license of course.&#x20;
* **Tests:** expressive and functional.
* You can't copyright methods of operation.
* You can't copyright ideas.&#x20;
  * Originally, software code was not copyrightable in the original decisions.
  * This was because machine code was considered to be math formulas.&#x20;
  * Math formulas are facts & you can't copyright that.
  * Code is just simply math in a different form.
  * But this changed in Altai, 982

### Abstraction Filteratoin-Comparison Test

Under this leading test, expressive features of the program's literal & non-literal elements are first examined at multiple levels of abstraction.

These levels range from the program's most abstract to its most concrete expression and, as noted by at least one court, can often be parsed into at least 6 levels of generally declining abstraction:

* The main purpose
* The program structure or architecture.
* Modules
* Algorithms & data structures
* Source code
* Object code.

Also, derivative work isn't copyrightable. If I steal Facebook's code and convert it from Javascript to Typescript, I can't copyright the Typescript.&#x20;

You can also include code nobody would use by leaving breadcrumbs. Maybe you did things not in the most straighforward way so if someone copies your code,&#x20;
