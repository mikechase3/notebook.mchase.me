## Why Right to Privacy

* **Risk**: telling people where you work creates risk because it can be targeted by a foreign power or someone who wants to murder you.
* 30 years ago, it would've been harder but today, technology makes information more accessible to the public.&#x20;
* **Unexpected Risks:** mom can find out you're buying engagement rings or smth.
* **Aggregated data:** if you're looking up a certain type of supplement, Google might predict that you're pregnant & treating you as such. Other people can see you're pregnant. Google infers how old we are, if we're married, etc.

## Consent

* **Forced to consent**: with phones, there's really no choice. It's unfair because you have to have one to live in society regardless of whether/not you agree with how it's used.

## Sources of Privacy Law

1. Constituion and amendments suggest stuff.
2. State/provinence constitutions.
3. Common law torts (things that happened before)
4. Federal & state statues
5. Administrative agency rules & actions.

A lot of the law we developed came out of a free-market capitalism approach so it favors the businesses.&#x20;

## Private Digital Data

### India

Normative framework of a free & fair digital economy.&#x20;

1. Legitimate state interest&#x20;
2. Restriction is necessary & proportionate to achieve the interest.
3. Restriction is by law.

### US

* **4th amendment**: search/seizure
* **5th**: no person shall be compelled to be a witness against him/herself.
* 8th, 9th: something.

### Examples of Private Data Usage

* Law enforcement is purchasing data records to learn stuff about criminals ([FOG](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/inside-fog-data-science-secretive-company-selling-mass-surveillance-local-police))
* AT\&T, T-mobile, and others sell your real-time live location.

## Subpoenas and Warrants

* **Warrants**: require probably cause and are difficult.
* **Subpoenas**: are easy to get.&#x20;
* **Emails**: subpoenas are enough.&#x20;
* **Devices:** Customs & border protection can freely search devices without a warrant. Others require a bit more work.

### Geofence Warrants

* Reverse warrants which violate right to privacy.&#x20;
* This asks the question: if someone breaks in your home, can the police get a geofence warrant to see who was all in the area when the house was broken into. That's generally considered a violation of the 4th amendment because someone else in the area will get blamed.

## Common Law Torts

1. **Intrusion upon seclusion**: means that they broke in sorta.
   1. They intended to intrude upon me.
   2. I had a reasonable expectation of privacy.
   3. Intrusion was highly offensive to a reasonable person.

## Readings

* [Livestreaming Traffic Stops](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T13gScf977tHazsxg0Tx\_kgdbUiKZVmlGu4XjYHJrX4/edit?usp=sharing): is it legal to livestream for your protection? The police officer asked if he was streaming & the officer said that streaming was a safety issue & lets everyone know that we're out here. Officer had immunity & plantiff lost, but on appeal Sharpe's lawyers argued that the livestream was based on a "fanciful chain of hypotheticals involving a third party seeing Mr. Sharpe's livestreaming, deducting the location of the traffic stop, driving to the scene, and attempting to harm the officers."&#x20;
* [Equifax's Security overhaul](https://docs.google.com/document/u/3/d/1DFJn2Fvl0HsPIo-3xe09ZBbvSSHUT0ih34EN06IBNCA/edit?mode=html\&usp=sharing): Hackers entered Equifax's network and stole financial information. They had to hire a chief information security officer. FTC got involved.
* Data on your mental health: after asking a broker 11 companies were willing to sell bundles of data including what antidepressants people were taking, whether they struggled with insomnia/attnetion issues, and other details on their medical ailmments like alzheimer or bladder control issues with addresses, incomes, etc. HIPAA restricts what covered health entities share, but it doesn't protect the information anywhere else so app makers can sell them.&#x20;
* Google & Illinois Biometric Info Privacy Act (BIPA): Google got sued because Google Photos uses, sorts, and stores peoples' facial information making Google basically like China.&#x20;
* Psychological data breach harms:&#x20;
