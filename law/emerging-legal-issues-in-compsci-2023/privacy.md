# Privacy

## Why Right to Privacy

* **Risk**: telling people where you work creates risk because it can be targeted by a foreign power or someone who wants to murder you.
* 30 years ago, it would've been harder but today, technology makes information more accessible to the public.&#x20;
* **Unexpected Risks:** mom can find out you're buying engagement rings or smth.
* **Aggregated data:** if you're looking up a certain type of supplement, Google might predict that you're pregnant & treating you as such. Other people can see you're pregnant. Google infers how old we are, if we're married, etc.

## Consent

* **Forced to consent**: with phones, there's really no choice. It's unfair because you have to have one to live in society regardless of whether/not you agree with how it's used.

## Sources of Privacy Law

1. Constituion and amendments suggest stuff.
2. State/provinence constitutions.
3. Common law torts (things that happened before)
4. Federal & state statues
5. Administrative agency rules & actions.

A lot of the law we developed came out of a free-market capitalism approach so it favors the businesses.&#x20;

## Private Digital Data

### India

Normative framework of a free & fair digital economy.&#x20;

1. Legitimate state interest&#x20;
2. Restriction is necessary & proportionate to achieve the interest.
3. Restriction is by law.

### US

* **4th amendment**: search/seizure
* **5th**: no person shall be compelled to be a witness against him/herself.
* 8th, 9th: something.

### Examples of Private Data Usage

* Law enforcement is purchasing data records to learn stuff about criminals ([FOG](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/inside-fog-data-science-secretive-company-selling-mass-surveillance-local-police))
* AT\&T, T-mobile, and others sell your real-time live location.

## Subpoenas and Warrants

* **Warrants**: require probably cause and are difficult.
* **Subpoenas**: are easy to get.&#x20;
* **Emails**: subpoenas are enough.&#x20;
* **Devices:** Customs & border protection can freely search devices without a warrant. Others require a bit more work.

### Geofence Warrants

* Reverse warrants which violate right to privacy.&#x20;
* This asks the question: if someone breaks in your home, can the police get a geofence warrant to see who was all in the area when the house was broken into. That's generally considered a violation of the 4th amendment because someone else in the area will get blamed.
