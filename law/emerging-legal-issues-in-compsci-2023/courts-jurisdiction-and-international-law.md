### Opening Questions

* There are potential challenges/limitations of relying on cultural values as a basis for legal principles in a multicultural society: legal interoperability, beliefs/contradictions.&#x20;
* **Tech Lawyers Programming/Coding Skills**: no, they just need facts.
* What role can individuals play in advocating for responsible/ethical technological development and raising awareness about the potential risks and challenges associated with technology.
  * Leverage social media for awareness.
* Civil law countries address the challenges of keeping their legal codes relevant in a rapidly changing society.
  * **Common Law** when a judge gets a new case against them, that judge has to make new law by ruling with/against a decision.
  * Both systems have statutes.&#x20;
* Does the latest technology make people feel like a utopia/distopia.
  * Utopian: self driving cars are nice
  * Dystopian: but china can spy on us better.

### International Jurisdiction

* Extradition treaties
* INTERPOL: international police submission to arrest an individual in foreign countries.
* There's no courts for countries w/ disagreements.

#### India Contractual Choice of Law

This didn't seem to be important:

* **Party autonomy**: Recognize a choice of governing law other than Indian Law
* Choice of foreign law can't derogate from the mandatory/overriding provisions of Indian law, or conflict with Indian public policy.
* Whether two Indian parties can contract out of Indian law is a grey area, although several decisions indicate this will be considered to be against Indian public policy.

#### Objections to Enforcement in India

* A foreign judgement must be conclusive to be enforceable.
* It has to be found on the correct view of India's international principles.

### Example: AI Generating False News about Jon Doe

California says elements of defemation are:&#x20;

1. Published:&#x20;
2. It's false:&#x20;
3. Unpriveleged: means it's not a governmental activity or official stuff.
4. Causes damage:&#x20;
5. Defendant's fault is **at least negligence**. But when you're famous or political, you have to prove at least malice.&#x20;

Here, the intent isn't malicious. You could argue the confidence threshold is low. California does have jurisdiction though.&#x20;
