#### Zittrain's Comments

1. Establishes technology is used against us with the deception of "helping" us.&#x20;
2. Technologies are pervasive and companies are using it unethically to spy on us.
3. Worries that tech is too powerful because there's no licensing for engineers.

#### Wark's Comments

1. Dystopia implies extremism rather than a range, but we're not experiencing total domination or anything extreme so calling it a dystopia is an overstatement.&#x20;
2. Technology was once useful for the common good, but now it's used to make rich people richer.
3. Technology should support the common good but instead parties are using it selfishless to gain power.

#### Gidari's Comments

1. Technology is here to stay and it'll have negative externalities, but it'll motivate society to extend benefits to all.
2. Tech isn't good or evil.
