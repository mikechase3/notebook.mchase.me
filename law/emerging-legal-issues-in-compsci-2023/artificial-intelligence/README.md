## Amazon Case Study

* In 2017, they used AI to figure out who to promote.&#x20;
* In North America, they used data on who stays promoted, who stays the longest, and who moves into a more managerial position.
* It would help Amazon in their internal candidates.
* **Problem**: the AI could typically keep preferring white men.&#x20;
  * They tried to leave out ethnicity & gender thinking it'll prompt out who it thinks should be promoted, but it later determined if you were in a sorority/fraternity as side factors to decide ethnicity & gender.
  * Amazon had to scrap the program.
  * When we have a systematic problem & there's a problem in the system with race & gender, how do you avoid that training with the AI?
* AI reveals bias that is occurring & re-highlights that particular problem

### Benefits of AI

* Health
* Safety
* Remove subconscious bias
* Scale
* Saves Time

## Discrimination in Hiring

* The AI evaluates the candidates scientifically.
* AI does not have explicit or implicit bias.
* The AI will focus on the merits & personality of the candidate and their fit for the role.
* Favorite sports tea or having a mutual connection.
* AI detects the interviewee's facial recognition
* AI captures data on the interviewee's enunciation & word choice.
* Facial expressions: real expressions & fake smiles to evaluate the applicant's nonverbal communication skills & fit for the job role.

### Example in English

* "These peanuts are very moreish, aren't they?
* If the HR person or AI doesn't think "moreish" is a word (even though it is in the UK), they'll be discriminated against because it's a _strange use of the word_.
* In Spain, they say "get down from the car" so in other states we'll hear that like Louisiana if you're evaluating them for a first round interview.

### Black People's Hair

* When dressing up for an interview, what is "dressing professionally?"
* For attorneys, they are dress-coded & have to wear a shirt/tie and all that.
* But black people might have an afro. Will they come off as unprofessional because of their hairstyle?
  * If they have photos on Instagram, will the AI impose that it's unprofessional/bad just because of their cultural heritage?&#x20;

### Word Choice

* If you say "I did", then you're less of a team player than the words "we did" the AI will be biased against the former.

## Law

### Illinois Bill

* In the hiring process, they're required to collect/report statistics of gender & ethnicity.&#x20;
* If you're reporting discriminatory data, you might&#x20;

### Discriminatory "Evidence" and "Proof"

* It depends on the claim
* Some require "malintent" while others say "circumstantial" evidence is okay.

## Liability

### Tesla Driving Case

* On the company website, it says "The person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself."
* Company also explicitly warned drivers they must keep their hands on the wheel & maintain control of their vehicles while using autopilot.
* Tesla's statements were conflicting
* Tesla's full self-driving costs $15K in hardware and $200/month for full self-driving.
