# Casting Judgement

In short:

* **Actions/decisions** are considered to be good if they are universalizable and do the most good for the greatest number of people. (And realistic in practice).
  * Sometimes these go at odds with each other; that doesn't necessarily make it bad.
  * Example: capitalism&#x20;
  * Popularity (w/o critical thought such as junk political ads).
  * Popularly (democracy-styled)
* **Efficiency**
* **People**
  * Are considered good if they demonstrate good decisions/actions.
