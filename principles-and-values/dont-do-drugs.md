# Don't do drugs

## Purpose

I know I'm in college and it's unpopular to take a stand against drugs and alcohol, but consuming them lowers your standards for everything you care about. Use alcohol when you're having fun with other people. When you're stressed or lonely or hopeless, don't use alcohol. Instead, refer to this list.
