# Principles and Values

## Commitment

* Place a **value on long-term relationships** by blancing short-term involvements with long term solution needs.
* **Share expectations** of time, supervisory roles, and commitments in relationships
* **Be honest about interests, intentions, and motives**. Be realistic as to not create false hope.
* Celebrate successes and address challenges together.
* Strive for genuine, active, and sustained organizational commitment to community partner and/or the issue being addressed.
* Always show up on-time for the person that makes you dinner, especially if it's inconvenient for you because it shows commitment/respect.

| IACT       | I earned a certificate in Integration and[ Applied Creativity for Transformation](https://udayton.edu/iact/academics/certificate.php), but the best learning experiences happened through IACT's failures as a program. The program is amazing because of those failures, and for failing fast and learning to recover from their failures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Someone... | Someone at work challenged nearly every argument I made, even if he agreed with it. 80% of the time, I was passionate about my point of view, but forgotten how I developed it and failed to explain how I reached that conclusion. I criticized a headset cleaner at work because I didn't believe UV killed viruses and infections, but didn't have sophisticated evidence to back it up. I told him about how I used AI to write many portions of my papers, but he challenged my code of ethics and specifically my integrity. I told him people would hate me if I assign them tasks in JIRA, and I learned to stop exaggerating to make a point or explicitly warn them how I'm going to exaggerate something. Someone taught me to not re-invent the wheels, even if it was more efficient to do so like sharing government files via Dropbox to avoid our office getting into trouble. Even though dropbox and cloud services are more efficient (and acceptable for non-classified documents at times), I should behave as others should. Finally, Tim believed me using three monitors and two computers was inefficient and was a waste of resources. He turned out to be right on that. Not only did I learn that more monitors doesn't make me more productive, but I learned the value of giving and accepting criticism - even for things that do not seemingly matter. |
