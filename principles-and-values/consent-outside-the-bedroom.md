# Consent Outside the Bedroom

## The Problem

> "I didn't consent to that!"
>
> "I assumed you'd be ok with it!"

1. Consenting to it once doesn't mean you've automatically consented to doing it again.
2. Some people have dietary restrictions.

## Why is Nonsexual Consent Important?

1. It makes others feel comfortable
2. It makes others feel like their desires matter and I respect how they feel.
3. It assures them they won't be in a scary situation.

## The Solutions

### Get Everyone's Input

Asking in advance conveys that enjoyment is a priority for you. **Get their input on anything you expect them to participate in.**

* Ask if someone is happy with the location before buying plane tickets.&#x20;
* Ask if everyone likes the dish you're preparing before buying the ingredients.
* Make sure your friends are happy with the destination if you're going out.
* Text the group if they have anything in mind themselves _before_ offering your suggestion.

### Keep Personal Information Secret

1. Do not repeat other people's secrets.
2. "It’s also important to recognize that someone’s decision to reveal information about themselves in one context doesn’t mean they want it aired in another" (Practice).

### Gain Consent before Non-Sexual Touch

I learned the hard way that not everyone like hugs. Some people have been touched inappropriately or have large personal bubbles.&#x20;

1. "Can I hug you?"

### Get Consent to Photograph

1. Don't photograph without their permission.
2. We should all get to decide if someone else owns a photo of us.
3. Ask if I can post this photo on Instagram.

### Forcing Discussions

* Anyone should be able to refrain or leave a conversation anytime it makes them feel uncomfortable.
* "You don't have to answer this if you don't want to"

### Don't Pressure Someone to Accept Anything

* There is pressure to.keep anything they don't give consent to. GIFT RECEIPTS!&#x20;
* "You don't have to eat anything you don't want."
* "I can exchange this if you want" (takes off the pressure to keep stuff)

### Decide in Advance How Expenses Will Be Split

* Decide if we're splitting the bill evenly (and you have to pay more than my share).
* At least offer to pay for your own meal or movie ticket.
* **Do not impose any unanticipated expenses**.&#x20;
* Overestimate costs and tell them how you're going to explicitly split expenses.

## Get Feedback Along the Way

If it's _probably_ ok, you can suggest the idea first before asking permission to do it.&#x20;

1. "May I try"
2. "Would you like if we did..."
3. "Do you like this?"
4. "Is this ok?"
5. I want to have sex with you.
6. I really want to kiss you right now.

## Make the Other Person Comfortable with Saying No

Most people say yes because they are afraid of saying no.

Talk about boundaries:

1. "I don't like the idea of making someone uncomfortable and I expect the same."
2. "It's ok if you'd rather not."
3. "What would you like instead?"
