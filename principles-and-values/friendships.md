### Avoid Embarrassment

A friend of mine plugged up the toilet recently, and my plumber didn't work. She felt awful because we ended up having to go to Home Depot and spending $15 to buy one which worked great. Anyways, I brought it up a few times and she asked me to stop because it embarrasses her.&#x20;

**Lesson**: If someone does something embarrassing, make sure they aren't _actually_ embarrassed. If they are, you get a maximum of 3x to make fun of them. Afterwards, stop.
