## A Lost Hamlet Monolgue About the Importance of Record Keeping

Rabbit-holes I've went down. I want to record them so I don't repeat my frustrations while trying to use my dad's 20-year-old UA-1000 Driver because that's a solid piece of equipment and I don't want to spend $1000 on a new interface with 8 inputs, 8 outputs, support for XLR and all that good stuff so when I walk into the Air-Force to run an audio setup I look like hot crap with my X-touch MIDI controller with one fancy motor fader people are always impressed by.

Until Catalina comes out and Apple is like "screw you guys" just buy a new interface. And now I'm stuck using old versions of Logic Pro on an old mac that can't handle newer, 4K displays I need to impress the people giving me funding because being able to present my work clearly and justify my work matters. As much as I wanted to justify spending $5K on my own audio setup, I bought a $200 mixing board and retired the UA-1000, which was mine anyways. But they laid out the schematic and it doesn't have a dumb name like _interfacia_ where they add things to the ends to brand themselves.

Anyways, [RIP old roland products](https://www.justanswer.com/computer/gw9gf-roland-electric-piano-no-longer-sending-midi.html) _technically Edirol_, but more in the spirit of good old devices with schematics drawn on them and oh my god my childhood is going to die if I don't maintain my devices running Windows 98/XP and why the heck did I sell Clay10s Mac Mini that was perfect for this job.&#x20;
