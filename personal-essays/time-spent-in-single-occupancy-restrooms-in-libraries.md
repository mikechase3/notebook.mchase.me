# Time Spent in Single Occupancy Restrooms in Libraries

The first and second floor of the Rosch Library each contain two single-occupancy restrooms located way too far away from the inconvenient, but larger restroom located far away from the desks students use to study for their exams. By determining the amount of time people spend in the first and second floors of Rosch library restrooms and inquiring why it was necessary to occupy the conveniently located restroom for so long,  the library can better allocate restroom usage more efficiently so students can return to producing useless paperwork. Two students on each floor were paid to question and record the amount of time each student occupied the restroom. Results reveals students using restrooms for longer than fifteen minutes were primarily utilizing social media, watching Youtube, and reading amongst other reasons.
