# Mike Chase's Opinions on Tesla

## Security

* **Cons**: Tesla's software is proprietary and they must sign all the software packages/updates. However,  proprietary software usually gets hacked. Zero-day attacks are scary as hell, especially software in an always connected computer.
* **Pros:** security patches.&#x20;
