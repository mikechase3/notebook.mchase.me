# Stocks

## Recommendation: Indexing

* Literally just buy $SPY if you're under 50.
* Each subsequent year after 50, move 2%/year to $BND (bonds; less risky)

### On Individual Stocks

* TODO

### On Options

* Don't.
* But if you do, expect that all options will expire worthless. Target <2% and only use if you have an extremely strong hunch that something good/bad will happen.
* Stick to [call debt spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debitspread.asp) to limit losses if you're wrong. (Also limits gains).

* TODO: Source numbers/statistics about how indexing beats picking/choosing at least 60% of the time. I think the percentage is higher, like 70 or 80% honestly, but don't remember.&#x20;
