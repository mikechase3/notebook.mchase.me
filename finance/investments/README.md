## Stocks and Bonds

* Currently, I buy index funds.
* But I'm in tech & tech is booming.
  * I've got tons of my portfolio in tech
  * Which goes against my "just index it" philosophy
  * Is that risky? AI is changing the world & has been over last ten years.
  * But now chat gippity came out and it's... oversaturated?
* Anyways - how do I know when to sell $MSFT, $AMZN, if we're innnnnnnnn a bubble?
  * And when do I get out?

Let's examine [the o-chem teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IBzTZqeyo0\&list=PL0o\_zxa4K1BVJoep\_XshasfnwHfCV\_JMf\&index=1)

### 01 Percent Changes

The first question is a math question of who made more money?

* 1 -> 2 = 100% return on investment because it doubles
* 1 -> 4 = not 400, but a 300% return on investment. (100 doubles, +100 triples, +100 quadruples)

Second question - what if stocks go down? If price starts at $10 -> $20 -> $5?

* Initial investment for John, Kelly, and Bruce buy 1000 shares at $10 = 10K.
* Different people do different things, but see the video.

The strategy is to take some money out and "trim the fat"

* Aka: Take some profit when the price goes up.
* Buy low, sell high as they say.

### 02 ROI Calculations

If Jon purchases a house for $250K and sells for $325K find ROI.

* **ROI** = Profit/COI \* 100%
* (325K-250K)/250K \* 100% = 30%
* The _Annual ROI_ is 30%/5yrs = 6%/year.
