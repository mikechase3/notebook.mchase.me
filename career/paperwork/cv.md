## History

### Childhood Experiences that Shaped Me

* **\~2000:** observed dad using PC to play wizardry video games and edit text.
* **\~2005:** Learned the ins/outs of Windows 98 when my dad brought in a computer around 2005 and placed it in my room. Used his for internet connectivity. Saved art to floppy drives.
* **\~2007**: got a Gameboy Advance, Nintendo DS Lite, Wii & began learning how to hack via cheating in video games sparking computerphile.
  * **Elementary RAM Hacking:** via Action Replay devices.
  * **Elementary Hardware Manipulation**: emulate behaviors like playing guitar hero without the guitar by pressing buttons on the wii remote; ordered & setup the Netflix DVD ROM; learned to turn off GBA before saves to record losing battles/money and continuing from last save; etc.
  * **Elementary Computer Usage:** googled Mario Bros cheats & warp-portals with the internet. Typed it. Printed it on dot-matrix paper.&#x20;
* **\~2010**: jailbreaking & script-kiddie hacking.
  * **School Networking:** would reveal the password in plain-text to recover password from teacher computers & bypass firewall restrictions.
  * **Social Engineering:** deployed a keylogger, had people type passwords into my computer, and then use their [webkinz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webkinz).
  * **Lighting Control Systems:** immediately drawn in theaters how pressing buttons lit up the stage differently.

### High School

* **Concert Band:** all four years I think.&#x20;
