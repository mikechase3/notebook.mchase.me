Some of the best systems&#x20;

## Scrap Notes

> What is your prespective (and why) on the distinction between product designers and system designers

In the context of most organizations, theree's a design team and it enables consuming teams (which consist of):

* Feature Team
* Prouct Team
* Marketing Team

This enables end users.&#x20;

> Most companies either can't afford or don't see the value in hiring both, so many organizations expect product designers to do both.

> "The performance of a system depends on how the parts interact, never on how the y act taken separately" - Prof. Russell Ackoff

* He recognizes some of the organizations only value innovation
* Others value standardization, cohesion, and efficiency.

It's not actually that black & white. There are seasons of innovation

* Which approach (and why) would you take with a brand new design system?
* **Inside out**?: starting with foundational things like color/type
* Or **Outside In:** starting with larger patterns in the products?

He/they learned that most people thought the best approach was the inside out. You can't build the experience until you look at the inside out.

> "The foundational bits are a force multiplier. It's worth the investment to...?

But another person said the design systems are overbuilt with parts that aren't often used.

> A more iterative approach to building only what teams actually need means less maintenance down the road.

His favorite response:

> This is a trick questionk, isn't it :)

| Inside Out                                                                     | Outside In                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Benefits**                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| High impact                                                                    | Solve substantial problems early                                                                                                                                     |
| Low effort                                                                     | Easy to tie to rpoduct roadmaps. Your existing product owners & roadmaps aren't thinking "we need to rethink how we do colros" they'er thinking what customers want. |
| Easy for product teams to use: you can give them pieces & let them pull it in. | Meets consumers & subscribers where they are. Meets them int heir workflow.                                                                                          |
| Enables systematic design thinking: you'll think more systematically           | Builds only what you need. (You don't imagine what you need in the future & make things you'll never use).                                                           |
| **Risks**                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Very easy for scope to creep                                                   | Can create tech debt                                                                                                                                                 |
| Foundations are out of context. You don't know what you really need.           | Hard to go back once components are in-use                                                                                                                           |
| Creates too much rigidity                                                      | Without solid foundations systems don't scale.                                                                                                                       |

> In real life, we vacillate between looking inward and outward. (Vascillate: To be unable to choose between different courses of action or opinions; waver). &#x20;

> The questions scientists raised were not "who are you" but "what is it"? Nobody asked the plants "what can you tell us?" The primary question was "how does it work" - Robin Wall Kimmerer, Braiding Sweetgrass.

## Questions of Synthesis

* Tell me about the structure of your og?
* How would you describe the culture of your company?
* Describe the landscape of products your company offers?
* How is your success measured by the organization?

## Questions of Analysis?&#x20;

I guess everyone does this so he doesn't need it?&#x20;
