Essentially this allows you to make prototype apps with small features easily. I have not finished my evaluation as it requires an account, but it is something a colleague recommended I check out at some point.



### Conclusion

An evaluation is pending. Perhaps a useful idea would be some web apps/services for my small business at dam-it.tech such as an uber-style tracker for my technicians and their status of the repairs and a ticketing system.
