# Element.io (Matrix Chat)

* [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is an open-source protocol for secure, decentralized communication.&#x20;
* Element.io is one host/server/provider of these servers.

### Conclusion

* While Matrix seems to be open source, it's not "free." Rather, it's freemium.&#x20;
* Element.io has a [community edition](https://element.io/server-suite/community), but it cannot run on air-gapped machines/networks so I question its effefacy.
