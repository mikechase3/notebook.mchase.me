## Project Initialization & Setup

First, I made an empty repository on Github and cloned it.  I already had Ubuntu WSL, so I had PyCharm configure a virtual environment in the Ubuntu environment at `/home/<username>/.virtualenvs/<repository_name>/bin/python`. The environment should look something like this:

.

Next, I installed all the packages I thought I needed. Most of these were dependencies that get installed, but I manually added streamlit, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy. The rest were generated or installed in the base environment.

I probably fiddled around with some other stuff
