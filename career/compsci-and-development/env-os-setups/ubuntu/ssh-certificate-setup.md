# SSH Certificate Setup

See `My_Gitlab/thoughts/docs/2025-scrapwork/october/20251001.md` for a draft that includes private  notes.

When you want to use Gitlab or Github or connect to systems remotely, it helps to have an SSH key setup. Every security person will tell you to generate a key for every device and don't use the same key across multiple systems, but I say life is too short now that we live in a world where Cloudflare makes me solve puzzles, do 2FA, etc... so in my opinion, I'd rather just encrypt the key and keep them secured across computers unless it's super sensitive.
