# IRC Daemon Server (UnrealIRCd)

Tonight, I spun up a Ubuntu virtual machine and got Ubuntu 22.04 on it. The goal is to replace Discord as our meeting spot & use IRC. Maybe with a bridge to the {other protocol I'm forgetting... Jabber/Jitter?}

[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) is the protocol that [IRC Daemons (IRCd)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRCd) use when deployed on servers. This guide currently only discusses UnrealIRCd, but I hope to continue resarching this subject and perhaps implement it myself sometime.&#x20;

## UnrealIRCd Installation

### Important Resources

1. The i[nstallation guide](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Installing_from_source) for \*NIX systems. There's a Windows version too I don't cover here.&#x20;
2. [UnrealRCD Home](https://www.unrealircd.org/)
3. Wikipedia pages for IRC and IRCD (See above).
