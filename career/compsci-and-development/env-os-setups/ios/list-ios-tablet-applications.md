# List iOS Tablet Applications

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is historical & no longer accurate. Once upon a time I'd keep and transfer applications maintaining the same iPad layout which was laborious but saved me time. Software/technology changes too fast to mainain this documentation. I'm keeping it for nostaglic reasons & remember the games I used to play no longer appeared downloadable from the App store.

## Lost Hamlet Monologues

I've had a strong love of tablets in my life from way before they were cool. I remember literally shedding a tear or two when I saw how awesome the software was on iOS iPads were, and while I wished there was more I/O like a USB port I liked the concept a lot.

Anyways, I couldn't afford an iPad because those were expensive, so I had this loong series of trading up like one of those business games you play as a kid when you take something useless from your parents house like some gift coffee mug that's still in a box that's been sitting around for the last 9-months that nobody knows what to do with because we have enough mugs and we're trying to re-gift it or bring it to our family's annual "gifts-nobody-wants-games" Christmas event.
