# Microsoft Activation Scripts

For research only & old systems, checkout [massgrave.dev](https://massgrave.dev/). Don't use this for any internet-connected or for actual usage because it could hack/break other things and isn't official and not legal if you're trying to actually use it on an OS you use. But if you're testing on if Windows will install on something it'll let you confirm/deny if windows is able to be installed on the device before you wipe it and buy a product key and official installation.&#x20;
