# Digital City Twin

## Mission

* **Core Concept**: I'm building an interactive, 3D simulation environment in UE5 where users can practice Active Directory penetration testing techniques within a semi-realistic hospital context. The goal is progression from low privilege (guest) to high privilege (domain admin).&#x20;
* **Educational Tool**: this is primarily for training/education, a collaboration between a university and a hospital (potentially involving the abilities connection - TAC). This means usability, clear objectives, and feedback are more important than hi-fi graphics or complex gameplay, at least, initially.
* **Phased Approach**: the hospital is part of a "digital city" initiative, but the hospital is the starting point. The architecture I build (interaction systems, hacking interface, objective tracking) can potentially be reused or adapted for future environments (banks, university). I will keep modularity in mind, even now.
* **Technical Core**: UE5 environment, interactable elements (comptuer, RFID), external simulation link (text file/python for now. Later on, an azure server0, Active Directory focus (GOAD inspired).
* **Prototype Nature**: it doesn't need to be perfect, polished, or even 'fun' in the traditional sense yet. It needs to demonstrate the concept and the core technical integrations. Functionality over aesthetics for now.
* **Workflow and tools**: version control for large assets (Git LFS) and managing planning documents across multiple tools might be challenging.
  * OneNote for jotted down ideas
  * [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/dam-it/digital-city-twin/-/issues) for the repository, issue board, milestones, etc.
  * UE5 for the living game.
