# Digital City Twin

## Mission

* **Core Concept**: I'm building an interactive, 3D simulation environment in UE5 where users can practice Active Directory penetration testing techniques within a semi-realistic hospital context. The goal is progression from low privilege (guest) to high privilege (domain admin).&#x20;
* **Educational Tool**: this is primarily for training/education, a collaboration between a university and a hospital (potentially involving the abilities connection - TAC). This means usability, clear objectives, and feedback are more important than hi-fi graphics or complex gameplay, at least, initially.
* **Phased Approach**: the hospital is part of a "digital city" initiative, but the hospital is the starting point. The architecture I build (interaction systems, hacking interface, objective tracking) can potentially be reused or adapted for future environments (banks, university). I will keep modularity in mind, even now.
* **Technical Core**: UE5 environment, interactable elements (comptuer, RFID), external simulation link (text file/python for now. Later on, an azure server0, Active Directory focus (GOAD inspired).
* **Prototype Nature**: it doesn't need to be perfect, polished, or even 'fun' in the traditional sense yet. It needs to demonstrate the concept and the core technical integrations. Functionality over aesthetics for now.
* **Workflow and tools**: version control for large assets (Git LFS) and managing planning documents across multiple tools might be challenging.
  * OneNote for jotted down ideas
  * [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/dam-it/digital-city-twin/-/issues) for the repository, issue board, milestones, etc.
  * UE5 for the living game.

## Hack Dayton Flyer Pitch

* Headsets
* Get into different office spaces w/ RFID
* Showing the "physical world" of VR.
* Connect physical, digital, and virtual environments and deploy in an educational
* Build Dayton as the next cybersecurity challenge.&#x20;
* CyberProAI - provides cyber ranges. Offers an educational solution that can be from your home instead of having to do it in-person. Experience cyber wargame exercises.

> Why do we need this?

* There's a 500K job fill gap? Entry level roles still require 3-5yrs experience. When you have kids starting in high school testing live infrastructure & have a real understanding of what those jobs involve they'll transition more easily into the workforce.
* Colegate programs do not do enough hands-on work.&#x20;
  * Too scripted
  * Sticker heist & digital city are a "choose your own avenue". There are multiple avenues of how you can move between them.
  * Easy, medium, hard, and very hard mode on the sticker heist & develop different levels of understanding.
* EMMA - has been doing CTFs since she was 12. No college degree, but has certs & is one of the best hackers on the team.&#x20;
* Brett isn't interested in making money, but just putting as many educational resources as we can. Lots of good wil w/ other education providers. That differentiates him.&#x20;
  * National science foundations grant allowed them to give sticker heist boxes out for free with grant money.

### Plan of Sustainability

* Finding others that are similar-minded.
* A lot of cybersecurity is supported by the good will of those in the US.
* Bring up the next generation.&#x20;
* The gap between graduates & those in the workforce is large.
  * Finding other like-minded individuals.
  * Better wages, work/life balance.

### Other Companies

* Offensive company 30 staffed
* Support banks, industrial control systems, defense contractors.
* 12 people in Dayton were developed from hack Dayton in the workforce.
* Second company builds software project that upscale cyber-security professionals to do it with more .
* Grant money, educational resources, etc., can help outreach and build new devices, ranges.

### Other Partners

* SANS institute is a global partner giving an outlet to show digital twin cities.
* Strategic partners in DC. The TAC (technology advancement center) similar to the hub.
* Individuals with their own talents (like me, making a VR space to play on).
  * VR is a word & we'll keep that.

At the age of 26 he was a drain cleaner...&#x20;

* Went to Sinclair. Mike brought him into his hacking team. TechnologyFirst. Learned how to pitch & present himself.
* Introuced him to Mr. Alex Fry; built some companies.
  * Build educational services & software within cybersecurity.
  * Desperately needs.

### Team Members

* Mike Chase
* UD Business fraternity with marketing, SEO.&#x20;
* Offensive security engineers through his firm. Lets them present their skills & challenges.
  * Jake - physical expert. Used to break into prisons for his day job.
  * Runs lockpicking & other seminars with physical devices you can compromise.
* Trust built into the system in nefarioous ways to show them what could go wrong & how to remediate that.
* UK key & lock systems are much better. Identify the holes & gaps to omve into a safer future.
* Chip company builds the circuit board, it's a raspberry pi, and a welding companies.

### Social-Venture Opportunities

> Have you thought about... ? in the future. Good opportunity - thought about making money?

* Non-profit does not mean no money.
* Building other smallre companies that'll support these outreaches.
  * Manufacturing, technological development of ranges/challenges.
* Sticker Heist - funding until 2026. AFRL & Dayton Children's & UD Flyer pitch will let us develop technologies.
  * Wright State & Miami will be interested in having their own "ciites".
* It's not hard to get money. It's about allocating it to underdeveloped/underserved cities (that aren't in CA)
* Midwest is the largest _emerging technology_ industry in the world.&#x20;
* Oio is the centerpoint for that.&#x20;
