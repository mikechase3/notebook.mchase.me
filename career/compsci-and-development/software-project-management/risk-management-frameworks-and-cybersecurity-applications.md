# Risk Management Frameworks & Cybersecurity Applications

.



I'm going to run this through chat gpt at the end but here's my raw notes:

> Most people are working for a government entity & don't need to focus on 'not being caught as much.' This hasn't happened traditionally ever and there's a lot of instances of hackers taking advantage of that. If there's a simple one that takes down whole companies... that's bad. This is the biggest trend in software project management.

> They go after companies with ransomware or ransom warranties where companies take control of resources and data or they'll delete this or expose it and that's what smaller groups do stuff. Nation state can be ransonware but it's more smaller groups and that's a discussion for outside of this class.\

> **Backdoors**: the current trend in the last 5 years is to think of this, plan for it, and have standards during the software security process.\

> Beofre, it was like you'd make one tool that does everything so you'd make it in-house. But as software development has become easier or there's been more resources, you don't want to re-build the wheel. So rarely, do the tools/projects have been designed in just your ecosystem so you're not building it but you use external ones. And then you build backdoors so people have avenues to get into your ecosystem. The biggest improvement has been cloud computing which opens backdoors. Whateveer the case, whether or not they use cloud resources they use open source tools with the idea that it can be cloud-deployed one day. \
