# Kanban

* Agile has defining features, but usually a team will pick a popular framework like scrum, Kanban, Hybrid, Lean, Bimodal, XP, Crystal.
* Scrum is an **implementation of agile** with fixed-length development iterations.
  * Scrum is also the most frequent form of Agile.
  * Prof likes them for well-defined tasks like a scoped project with clear deliverables.
* Kanban works off the idea of **continous release** that's often left for more open-ended tasks.
