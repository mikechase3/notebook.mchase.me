# Sprint Planning

## Introduction

* Plans Change
  * We constantly update plans & graphics
  * If scope changes, then we go in, and update our plans.
  * The 'higher-level' we keep plans, the easier it is to change.
* **Planning is an investment.**

## Refining Plans

* It's answering a question when we have a much better grasp of what it even is.
