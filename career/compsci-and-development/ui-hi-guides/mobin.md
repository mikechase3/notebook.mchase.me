## What is it?

Well - I thoguht it was going to let you make some UIs, but it doesn't do that. From their Q/A:

* Mobbin is the world’s largest UI & UX reference library.
* It’s always up-to-date, includes mobile and web, and lets you filter by specific app categories, UI elements, flow patterns, and more.

## Registration & Pricing

* They have a student plan of $60/year.
* Google forms for student verification is pretty easy.
* Looks like it's just some UI?
* Pattern library - kinda useless..
