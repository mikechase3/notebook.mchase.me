When going to the EU, you need to block different frequencies. Specifically, you need to move from ISO (International Organization for Standardization) code 3166-2:US to ISO 3166-2:GB (for great Britain). Find a full list of country codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes).

To do this... just install custom firmware because they make it too difficult... I cloned/installed [this](https://momentum-fw.dev/) though it's not ideal because it doesn't block the US frequencies still :(
