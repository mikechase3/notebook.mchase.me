## Background

Unknown.

* **New Zealand**: an underground network. Cognitive warfare.
* It's who controls the narrative controls reality.&#x20;

### Use Case 3: Contract for Hire

* Execution of one smart contract through some targeted DDoS and forced routing through compromised infrastrucutre which triggers Armadeddon - compound ? and credit.

### Under Seige - How to Isolate a Nation

* They're going to attack New Zealand
* Cut an undersea cable - that can certainly happen.
* Coordinated multiple-domain attack engineered to create cascading failure across domains & subsystems.
*

#### Process

1. Insert some sort-of glitch.
2. Cut an undersea cable.
3. Ram or Jam a satellite
4. Scuttle a ship. (Gets stuck?, causes a cascading failure).
5. **Outcome:** cascading failure & persistent isolation.
   1. Communication, transportation, finance, utilities, and emergency services collapses.
   2. If there is a viable attack path, it is a mathematical certainty that someone or some things will eventually model it.
   3. Figure out how to find the attack paths & then patch it?&#x20;
   4. Lots of critical infrastructure has little or no protection.

## Call to Action

### Model, Assess, and Simulate

* Multiple domain view.&#x20;
* Automate & integrate.
* Focus on what matters.

### Governance

* Global asset registry
* Holsitics risk register
* joined up stakeholder community

### Operationalize Insight

* Remove discretion, make it easy to do the right thing & hard to do the wrong thing.
