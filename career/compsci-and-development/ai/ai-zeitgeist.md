## When AI Comes to Town

### Commentary

The era of staring at a blinking cursor and writing code line-by-line is ending. AI is fundamentally reshaping software development, and the effects are counterintuitive.

**The stock market surprise**: I expected software companies to soar as AI improved productivity. The opposite happened. Much of the software being written is becoming obsolete because the barrier to entry has collapsed. Anyone can now perform entry-level development tasks with AI assistance.

**The new role of software engineers**: The value has shifted. Junior developers who could only write basic code are being displaced. Senior engineers who understand complex tooling, large codebases, and diverse technology stacks are becoming force multipliers. The job is less about typing code and more about orchestrating systems, understanding architecture, and knowing which tools to apply.

**Institutional lag**: Some sectors, particularly large enterprises and regulated industries, haven't felt the full impact yet. But the transition is coming for everyone.
