# Colearning: Human/AI Teaming Vision
From slides - distribution A. Approved for public release. Case No AFRL-2025-2905
## Huma Autonomy Teaming Review
(Lyons, Scyra, Lewis, Capiola, 2021)
* Relevant team dynamics: shared mental models, team-oriented intent communications.
* **Challenges**: optimize the performance of human-machine teaming. 
    * How do you foster relationship w/ computer? (Vector spaces, knowledge graphs)
    * How do you measure if they have the same mental model?
    * HAT training. How does it update?
    * How to foster joint awareness of attention, state monitoring, confusion/uncertainty.
    * Who is accountable? How?

## HMT Considerations
Interactivity - humans update information well, but we don't know when they're doing it.
* What happens with these is hard for computers to do.
* How do you adjust weights/etc.

### Autonomy
* Most of it is happening manually, but more and more it'll be autonomous.
* We're a piece of the larger pie... trying to get to higher autonomy but that's down the road.

### Orbital Games Example
* Different types of games exist.
* Satellite vs Satelite.
* Satellite vs Constellation.
* War gaming - figuring it out, but there's formats.
  * Sequential games: my actions will dictate someone elses
  * Dual games: both take actions at the same time.
  * Nash Equilibrium / prisoner's dilemma.
  * Rudimentary Asequential Deterrence Game (Sequential).
* UC Boulder: trying to apply to Bassilisk. Hidden Markov model?
* Col Blatto (Glatto?) Game: two players make decisions simultaneously & winner takes all (Concurrent Example)
