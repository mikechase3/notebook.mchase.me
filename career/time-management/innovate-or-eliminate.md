## Summary

* Simply first - then add. We jump to adding features too quickly when simplification is usually the right answer.
* Take guidance over advice: guidance is **have you thought about**. Advice is "you should change".
* It's okay to hear "no": suggest additional features rahter than deliver their honest opinions.
* Killing your own ideas is hard: practice and then return. Kill products & ideas that don't work.
