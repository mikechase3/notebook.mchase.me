# Inspiration

I'm happy to be here playing music for people which is one of my favorite things to do in the world. When I was young, I used to invite friends & put on a record. It's a real way to connect with people, see what they love, and learn what characters they connect with.

He completely revolutionized the instrument and how one plays in context with others. There's a great documentary film made a few years ago about Jacko. This song, played by Jacko which just blows my mind and still is like "wow, he must've been on such a trip and gone in the astral plane in the ether in the magical place. Here's Jacko, by himself, with one fender bass guitar, playing Portrait of Tracy.

* [Elmopalooza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAtrYL29Un4) - A Sesamie Street Music Concert. Hosted by Jon Stuart. There's a cantina band, hip-hop, and overall it's really wholesome/radical for the time. Musically, it's great and the kids will love it. Historically funny too. All jokes are G-rated.
