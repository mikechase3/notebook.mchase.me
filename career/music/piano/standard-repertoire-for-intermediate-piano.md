>      * **Recommended Editions:** Henle Urtext, Wiener Urtext, Bärenreiter, Alfred Masterwork. Dover edition is also available.

>    * **English Suites and/or French Suites (English/Franch suites urmajor/enovoij?):**
>      * **What it is:** Two sets of six suites each. They are foundational works in Bach's keyboard repertoire, generally considered intermediate to advanced. "urmajor/enovoij?" likely refers to "Urtext" edition.
>      * **What to look for:** "Bach - English Suites" (BWV 806-811) or "Bach - French Suites" (BWV 812-817). They are often sold as separate volumes or one combined volume for each set.
>      * **Recommended Editions:** Henle Urtext, Wiener Urtext, Bärenreiter are highly recommended for Urtext. Alfred Masterwork editions are also good.
>    * **Two-Part Inventions:**
>      * **What it is:** A collection of 15 short contrapuntal pieces, excellent for developing hand independence.
>      * **What to look for:** "Bach - Two-Part Inventions."

Schirmer, but it's a scholarly edition and an exception to the "no Schirmer" rule if this specific one is intended) is a standard reference, though it might be more than you need.
