# Types of Interviews

## Phone Interviews

* They are less intimidating
* You can have your notes nearby for reference.
* **Challenges**: It's hard to make a strong impression and build rapport without nonverbal cues. It's hard to feel like you're getting to know someone when you can't lean forward or convey charisma with only your voice.
* Make an extra effort to bring positive energy to the interview.
* Get comfortable with moments of silence.

## One-On-One In-Person Interview

* This lasts 20-45 minutes. The majority is Q/A.
* Can they see themselves working with you?
* Wrap up and discussion of next steps.
* **Avoid**: talking fast, fillers like ums/uhs.

## Video Interviews

* Get comfortable with being on camera.
* Give thought to background, lighting, camera angle, and powder your nose.

## Panel Interview

* You'll be meeting with 2-4 people.
* Find out as much as you can about the specific format.
* Find out **who is going to be there.**
* **Connect with everyone**: you must include everyone and build report with each individual by alternating eye contact and focus. Make sure everyone in that panel thinks you're a great fit.

## Group Interview

* Mingling activities, separate 1-on-1 interviews.
* Most companies will provide you with an agenda.
* Be yourself, but yourself at your best.
