# Dinosaurs: Sauropods

## Basics

* These are the giant quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaurs.&#x20;
* They were huge. 130' long and about 24' tall.&#x20;

## Types

* Diplodocids
  * Thin, "pencil" teeth.
  * Nostrils are on the top of the head
* Camarasaurs & Brachiosaurs
  * Spaculade deeth.
* Brachiosaurus
  * Collosal.
* Apatosaurus
  * Not as heavy:&#x20;
  * Aka Brontosaurus: "thunder lizard". Someone else identified them differently, but after more analysis, they turned out to be the same thing.
  * They had put the camerasaurus skull off the wrong body they originally had it on. Some scientist put the wrong skull on a body and put a camarasaur head on it.&#x20;

## The Giant Sauropods

* How does an animal weighing 80 tons, small heads, and weak teeth, produce a body that big and survive?
  * Wouldn't it be easier if it lived in water to help it lift up the majority of the body mass.

### Semi-Aquatic Lifestyle Debate

It was hypothesized that maybe Sauropods live semi-aquatically because:

1. Huge size to support mass.
2. **Weak pencil teeth**: water will make the food mushy & easier to eat.
3. **Fossils found in carbonate sediment**: carbonate is limestone and limestone that precipitates out of water.&#x20;
4. Nostrils on top of skull.

Bob Bakker, author of Dinosaur Heresies reinterperts the evidence. Each number counters the corresponding number above.

1. If you look at the details of the anatomy, it doesn't indicate that most of the time time was spent in water. These dinosaurs have legs with spots for carilidges, so they're not lightly built as one would expect in water, but they are built for land. Also Pleurocoels in vertebrae and deep, narrow chests.
2. **Gastroliths**: stomach rock. We think that someone ate stuff, swallowed everything, and there were gastroliths that acted like rocks and grinded food, so it was ok to have weak pencil-like teeth because these things would grind it down.
3. River Flood **Kunkar** Deposits & Ooliths/Ooids/eggs: the ones associated with dinosaurs are unlike other ones? To Bob, he asks "where do you find these?" It turns out, this is called Kunkar, India under terrestrial, well-drained, semiarid environment. Maybe those aren't ooids, but instead a flood-plain deposit, meaning it is part of a river system.

In summary, the anatomy seems to suggest they have lived on land, not on water.

## The Cretaceous Tertiary Extinction Event

* Today, we believe the catastrophe happening 66M years ago, causing the extinction of dinosaurs, was the result of meteorites.
* Things that became extinct: single-celled microfossils, ammonites, many marine reptiles, all the flying reptiles, rudist clams, and dinosaurs.

## Dinosaur Extinction Theories

These are wrong. This is the type of stuff Dr. Goldman believed growing up because othe rpeople told him to blindly believe this:

1. ~~Outcompeted by mammals; mammals ate dinosaur eggs. Mammals were just better and therefore, the dinosaurs just became extinct~~ Not true.
2. ~~Evolution of new plant fauna.~~&#x20;
3. ~~Thin & brittle egg shells.~~
   1. People speculated/noticed shells were medioctre.
   2. There is no evidence the eggs didn't match healthy/living dinosaurs.
4. Climate change & ocean chemistry change.
5. ~~Geomagnetic field reversals~~
6. Increased volcanism & climate change
7. Sea-level fall - climate change.\
   Extra-terrestrial causes
   1. ~~Supernovae~~ (Too catastrophic = bad)
   2. Meteorite/asteroid impact.
