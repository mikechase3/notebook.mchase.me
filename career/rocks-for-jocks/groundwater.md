# Groundwater

Definitions - vadose zone, phreatic zone, porosity, permeability, aquifer, aquitard, recharge, discharge, gaining and losing streams, cone of depression, monitoring well, artesian well, hydraulic gradient, hydraulic conductivity.

Ø  Groundwater Flow - **Darcy’s Law: Q = A** **k(h1-h2)/l** = **AV**

&#x20;                                      where A = cross-sectional area (porosity)

&#x20;                                      k is a measure of permeability

&#x20;                                      and (h1-h2)/l is the hydraulic gradient.&#x20;

Thus Darcy’s Law includes all major components of flow: hydraulic gradient (pressure difference),       hydraulic conductivity (permeability), and cross-sectional area (porosity).

Ø  Groundwater Problems -

a)     Over Pumping - subsidence and saltwater incursions.

b)     Contamination - Chlorinated solvents (DNAPL’s), LNAPL’s, pesticides, PCB’s, metals.
