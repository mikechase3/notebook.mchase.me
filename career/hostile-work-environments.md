# Hostile Work Environments

A friend of mine has quit a job. She needs to go back & fight for what she was awarded (her job). A teacher & someone who held her grade provided no warning that she was violating the contract by exceeding 10hrs/week.

Annie - you've got to talk to them & you've got to fight for yourself. Because I don't know if you necessarily deserved the job you had, but ther's no reason you needed to feel pressured to leave. That is an employment violation.
