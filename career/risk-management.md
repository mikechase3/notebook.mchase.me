# Risk Management

## 5-Step Process

Risk management is a 5-step process. It's not a safety process. It is a decision making process and a way to evaluate what we do. Some examples in life are educational pursuits and going to college where you spend too much money receiving a little bit of an education.

### Principles

* Accept no unnecessary risk.
* Make risk decisions at the appropriate level. (Raise problems to someone who can fix if something went wrong)
* Integrate risk management into operations, activities, and planning at all levels.
  * Don't wait until the last minute or when the job is already started before thinking about hazards.
* Apply the process cyclically and continuously.
  * Always keep an eye out for new hazards.

### Identifying Hazards

* Weather
* If you see something, say something.

### Assess Hazards

* Identify potential hazards early-on.
* Consider the probability that something will happen.
  * A box of anvils could kill someone.
  * A box of feathers won't do something.

### Develop Controls & Make Decisions

* Report possible problems to supervisors & leadership.

### Implement Controls

* Leadership usually does this part.

### Supervise & Evaluate

* Evaluate.
