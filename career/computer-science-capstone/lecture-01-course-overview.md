## Software Development Life Cycle

### Introduction

**Project**: A planned undertaking that has a beginning and end and produces some definitive result. Most projects fall on a continuum between predictive and adaptive:

### Predictive Approach

* Waterfall Model
* Assumes the project can be planned in advance and that the information system can be developed according to the plan.
* Requirements are well understood and/or low technical risk. 

### Adaptive Approach to the SDLC

* Iterative model \(we will use this approach in capstone courses\)
* Assumes the project must be more flexible and adapt to changing needs. 

## Agile and Iterative Development Approaches

### System Development Process

* This describes the actual approach used to develop a particular information system. _Aka a methodology_.

### Agile Development

An information system development process that emphasizes flexibility to anticipate new requirements during development. 

### Iterative Development

An approach to system development in which the system is "grown" piece by piece through multiple iterations:

### Unified Process \(UP\)

* An architecture-centric, use-case drive, iterative and incremental development process using UML

### Extreme Programming

* Aims to produce higher quality software.
* More responsive to changing customer requirements

### SCRUM

* A simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products..

## SCRUM

{% hint style="info" %}
The approach we're using in our capstone.
{% endhint %}

* Scrum is a development approach.
* Combination of principles of Rugby and Agile.
* Intense effort involving the entire team for a defined period of time.

### Product Backlog

* Prioritized list of user requirements.
* You can see a list of user requirements.
* The more requirements you have, the more detailed your project is.

### Product Owner

* The client stakeholder
* Controls the backlog

### SCRUM Master

* Project manager.
* Uses management tools to maximize efficiency.

### SCRUM Sprints

A sprint is a time-controlled mini-project that implements part of a larger program.

### SCRUM Practices

* The scope of each sprint is small and unchanging. Sometimes the workload is reduced.
* Daily SCRUM meetings
  * What have you done since the last daily SCRUM meeting?
  * What will you do by the next daily SCRUM?
  * What kept you or is keeping you from completing your work?

## Messenger Requirement Project

### Sprint

* Sprint 0: Requirements, analysis, and system design
* Sprint 1: Messenger 0.1: Architecture and UI Design/Prototyping
* Sprint 2: Messenger 0.2: Quality Analysis: Simple authentication
* Sprint 3: Messenger 0.3: Storing user data: database design and development.

### Labs

* Lab 0: Preparation \(GCP, git, trello, node.js\)
* Lab 1: A simple chat system app deployment on the cloud
* Lab 2: User registration and authentication
* Lab 3: Handle database for messenger. \(Google Firebase?\)

## Assessments

* 10%: Participation \(via multiple choice quizzes and teamwork\)
* 15%: Written quizzes
* 20%: Labs
* 35%: SCRUM projects in assignments
* 20%: Team project proposal for Capstone 2.
