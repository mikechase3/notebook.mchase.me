## Map

Once upon a time, I wanted to make a resource for all interns hired onto USAF like I was. I had dreams to create a website of sorts to share; however, due to this thing called  [opsec](https://www.cdse.edu/Training/Operations-Security/) and my desire to stay out of legal trouble, I've removed most of the public sites. It's now in Year/Career/\<JOB>/

I used to track publicly available sites here.
