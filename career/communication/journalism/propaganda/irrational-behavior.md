# Irrational Behavior

## Ted Talk: Dan Ariely

### Two Tables Optical Illusion

1. Dan shows 2 tables and measures them against an optical illusions.
2. When he points to the lines, they're identical.
3. When he takes them away, he forgets them.

_Response: this feels like me. I only remember the conclusions, not the premises._

* He does this with a rubrics cube too.

### Three Choices

* Rome with coffee
* Rome without coffee
* Weekend in Paris.

_Conclusion: Rome with coffee looks more favorable simply because one looks like a fantastic deal, even more so than Paris._

### Physical Attraction

* When you go bar hopping, take a **similar** but **slightly uglier** version of yourself.
* When there was an ugly Jerry, people dated not-ugly Jerry.
* When there was an ugly Tom, people dated not-ugly Tom.

## Coffee

* By distracting you a third choice, you make irrational behaviors.
* Adding a third example makes the decision much harder.
  * Nobody is going to choose the middle.
* By throwing in the $4 coffee, $5 looks like a much _better deal_.
  * _Look at how much I saved. I got so much more coffee for so much less._
  * Even though you made a quick reaction, you feel like you've made the right choice.

_**Conclusion: Give your audience a good reason to make themselves feel better.**_
