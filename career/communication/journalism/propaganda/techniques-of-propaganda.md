# Techniques of Propaganda

## Pre Persuasion & Credibility

* Pre-persuasion is a technique

## Authority

* Innate trust in experience and knowledge.
* Shuts down a lot of our critical thinking.
* Trust, quality thinking.

### Authority and First Appearance

* Lab coat has more perceived authority
* How fit are you, do they have facial symmetry, what is their emotional expression
* We assume good looking people have good, credible information.

### Authority and Putin

## Tradition and Culture

* Kim riding a horse links to Korean national identity.
  * Mount Paekdu part is part of ancient and modern Korean history.
  * White horses key to Kim II Sung's mythography
* This frames Kim as a strong, independent world leader.

## Be Funny

* Humor increases your general acceptance & liking
  * Positive feelings increase, while resistance to persuasion lowers.
  * It's _**harmless entertainment**_
* Most effective for immediate, impulsive decisions.
* It doesn't work for a sustained amount of time, but great quickly

## What if you're Untrustworthy, Unbelievable, and Disliked?

### Appear to argue & attack your own self-interests

1. Appear to have nothing to gain.
   1. Openheimer cautioning against nuclear development in 1960s.
   2. "You should pass this, even though it hurts me"
2. Attacking a _scapegoat source_

### Appear to not be trying to influence

1. _Hidden Camera_ testimonial advertisements
2. Create _Psuedo-Events_
   1. Like staged Red-Bull events.

## Deflective Source Model

* I am a propagandist
* If I come out as the source of the message, it's not going to be effective.

### 3rd Party

* Create a 3rd party
* It's setup to be _a source_ for the message, even though someone else creates it.
* It's coming from _these other people_, so don't blame me.

### Radio For Europe: Sample Deflective Source

* It's setup as a broadcasting service for cold Europe
* All you hear is that _Radio Free Europe_ is doing these broadcasts.
* Radio Free Europe is **a front.** It's actually scripted information from the USA, intentionally.
* They do this so their message is played to the public in communist Eastern Europe.
  * The public only sees _Radio Free Europe_ as a source.
  * This is because the US isn't very credible. The communist Russia doesn't trust the US, but they're much more likely to setup this independent information just because they're not in the US.

## Legitimizing Source Model

* The propagandist is sending the message
* But we pretend like we're _quoting someone else_.
* _**They**_ are telling you the truth.
  * I'm getting this statistic from this _independent research institute, not me._
* This comes from early anti-tobacco campaigns.

### Anti Tobacco Research Institutes

* It gets revealed every few years to publish studies that the Tobacco companies can say to defend tobacco.
  * _"Well, lots of things give you Tobacco."_
  * These aren't my numbers, you can trust me.
* By claiming this trustworthy, reliable source, I'm deflecting the attacks on me as a propagandist.

## Self-Generated Persuasion

## Sympathetic Anthropomorphism
