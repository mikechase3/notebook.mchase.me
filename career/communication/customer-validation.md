# Customer Validation

## HowTo

1. Set a goal
2. Create a hypothesis
3. Make graphs & stuff&#x20;
4. Design your experiment?

## Five Golden Questions

1. What's the hardest part about \<THE PROBLEM YOUR FACING>
2. Can you tell me about the last time something happened? (Those stories will reveal something you haven't even thought about your product & maybe you should incorporate them into your project)
3. (There were more)

### Games

* Walk me through the last time this problem happened?
* How did you try to solve this problem?
*



## Tidbits

* It's not a big problem enough if of a problem if the yaren't trying to sovle it on their own.
* Is the problem worth solving. If not, don't waste your time/energy. Fail early, fail fast.
* **Emperical** - experience based data from real customers to make informed decisions.

## Tricks & Hacks

1. Encourage the stories (e.g. tell me about a time)
2. Ask open-ended questions (walk me through)
3. Get to specifics (what's the worst)
4. Don't lead (e.g. would you like \<this> better this way>?)
5. Ask WHY (the first reason might not be the real reason)
6. Short Questions (ten words max)
7. Ask about past or present
8. Give time to answer (seven seconds is standard)
9. Don't cut & and don't get too excited.
10. Give them time to answer, again.
11. Look for inconsistencies.

## Testing

* Divide and conquer
* Meet your goals
* Go interview & talk to people

## Measure

* How does that data match our asssumptions?
  * Did it meet our expectations?
  * What surprised us?
* What does this mean for the next phases of development?

## Learning

* First assumptions are rarely currect.

## Summary

1. Surveys don't validate, they can only verify.
2. Go **interview** customers to validate if they had this problem
3. Apply the "mom test"?
