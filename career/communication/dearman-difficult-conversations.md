# DEARMAN Difficult Conversations

DEARMAN is a strategy for communicating effectively. It helps you express your wants/needs in a way respectful to all parties.

* **Describe**: facts removed from judgement
* **Express**: using 'I' statements to express feelings.
* **Assert**: what you want/need clearly. Be specific.
* **Reinforce**: reward the other person if they respond well via smiling, saying thank you.
* **Mindfulness**: don't get distracted from my goals or other issues
* **Appear Confident:** use body language to show confidence. Good psoture, eye contact, speak clearly, don't fidget.
* **Negotiate:** the limits of what you can accept, but be willing to compromise within them.
