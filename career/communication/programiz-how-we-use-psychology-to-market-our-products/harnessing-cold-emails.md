## The Sacred Quadrivium

For Christian and success, it's:

* Deliverability (Most important thing to focus on)
* Targeting (
* Messaging (
* Response handling (

If you can do those four things well, you'll do ok if you have a halfway decent offer and can drive revenue, meetings, signups, etc.

### Deliverability

What worked 18mo ago doesn't work today & what worked 6mo ago is already chaning. Deliverability is the foudnation of your entire email chain.

So, you need to do:

* Multi-Domain
* Multi-Inbox setups

What's this mean? When you work with a client, you're goingn to buy 100 domains. Maybe your domain is acme co and you want to buy literally a ton of domain names. You'll start putting inbox domains and three inboxes per domain.&#x20;

If each of those inboxes is only sending 15 emails/day, you're sending 450 emails per day and that's your capacity to send. Why not send 450 emails from your main email? You'd blow up deliverability for the entire domain name and you'd be blocked for **spam** most likely. If you're doing outbound emails to _new people_, you need to do multi-domain and multi-inbox setups. It'll create a "multi-headed hydra" where some burn and others still work which is a small segment of what you need to be successful.

#### Iinfrastructure Requirements

* Use Google inboxes, Microsoft Inboxes, and SMTP inboes.
* Keep bounce rates under 2% to avoid burning your infrastrucutre
* Domain age mattters & needs to be 15-30 days to warm up.&#x20;
  * Warm domains by sending fake emails to build a reputation
  * Expect infrastructure erosion over time and always be building new domains.&#x20;
  * For their clients, they buy new ones every 2 months.
  * Then they do these warming up cycles.&#x20;

#### Basic Approach

* **Basic**: you go buy domains. It's tedious. Then you go to Google and make admin panels for those domains. It takes a long ass time so use sequencer tools. Very educational.&#x20;
* **Intermediate**: use sequencer tools like **instantly.ai** which provides automated warming.
  * $40/mo for basic, but you might want to do the $90 one.&#x20;
  * You can buy domains and mailboxes through them and they'll set it up.&#x20;
* **Advanced**: use an agency level infrastructure (hundreds of inboxes)
* Remember, the house of cards collapses if ONE element of the above fails.&#x20;



### Targeting

* If you're not targeting well, you're wasting resouces.
* If using Apolo, make sure you use verified data.
* Use **clay.run** (Google sheets w/ APIs to clean the data)
* **Advanced**: data cleaning services (Reoon, Lead Magic)
* Don't skip the verification/cleaning step because it's worth every penny.
* 50K unverified contacts -> 10K targeted leads...

#### Clay

How can you enrich things quickly/easily?

* Clay is a tool that's like an ecel spreadsheet on sterroids
* Populate it with first names, last names, cities.&#x20;
* It'll try and find their email, title, and how much revenue their company has?
* Clay started a couple years ago and they had a $500M evaluation
  * It'll become the most powerful tool for entrepreneurs in the next five years.
* Target decision makers, not gatekeepers.
* Segment by industry, company size, role.&#x20;

#### Book Recommendation

### Messaging

* Evergreen Messaging
* Don't talk about **me**, talk about **we: the client's needs and pain points**&#x20;
* Traditional frameworks (AIDA, PAS, etc.? )
* Test value propositions systematically
* Works for established solutions with clear value

Incentives:

* Offer value before asking for value
* Examples: sports tickets, wiskey bottles, lead magnets
* Make it easy for prospects to say "yes".&#x20;

E.g.: by the way, I'm only one block over, why don't I send over a gift card and buy your team a lunch and learn?

What's a **trigger**:&#x20;

> Let's say you're selling software developmetn services and the company is just hiring a CTO or just hiring software developers, that's a trigger. We can scrape job postings every day and put them into our AI soup. Said we saw you're looking for developers... we can get you three full stack develoers in 72hrs, woudl that be of value to you?&#x20;

* Test all four message types (evergreen, incentive, trigger, AI)
* Track metrics for each types
* A/B test subject lines, opening lines, CTAs.
* Keep emails short, focused, and value driven.
  * First email is one sentence.
  * Second email is two sentences.
  * Third email is three things.
* Don't be another "terrible email" in their inbox.
  * Hey - we noticed you have this pain point.
  * Can we help you?

### Responding

Of all 500 emails you might get, you might respond to one or two of them. If it's a painpoint you have right on the button and perfect timing, you respond and get a little more information.&#x20;

If you send that email and you don't hear from them for three days. If it takes more than 30 minutes to do one of those emails, your chances of conversion go down 900%. If you wait a day or two, you've lost them.

If you respond while they're still sitting on their email in their 30 minute focus zone, you will convert.&#x20;

#### Speed to Lead

Lots of emails from clients were dropping the ball. It's called RevReply. You can do it yourself and setup automatic response handling instancly. They're called sub sequences.&#x20;

Never forget. If you're slow to respond, you will lose the opportunity every single time.&#x20;

## Tech Stack

* Having the right tools makes/breaks your email campaign
* Stack components... there was more. But Clay is more important.

### Data & Targeting Tools

* apollo.io: $1000/mo
* Way more we'll have to see later.&#x20;
