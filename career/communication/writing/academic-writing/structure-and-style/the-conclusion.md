# Conclusions

**The Conclusion**

The last paragraph of an essay should leave the reader with a final thought and a sense of closure. There must be a definite ending. A conclusion should accomplish the following:

1\. It should reinforce the main idea stated in the thesis statement.

2\. It should tie together all of the main ideas of the essay.

3\. It should leave the reader with a sense of closure.

**Techniques for Writing Conclusions**

The following techniques can be used to create effective conclusions.

1\. Restate your thesis.

a. Rewrite the main idea in your thesis but use different words and sentences to express the idea again for emphasis.

2\. Summarize your major points

a. Again, restate the major points covered in the thesis and the body to reinforce what you have said in the essay.

b. This technique is the most popular, but is it the best approach?

3\. Direct your readers’ attention to consequences or future directions

a. The following conclusion ends with a look at the possibilities for future research in Native American languages.

b. Maya was long considered the only true writing system to have developed in the New World. Now we know that another written language, perhaps belonging to the Olmec people, developed more or less independently. Some four hundred glyphs are discernible on the stela. Simply on the basis of their variety Grube speculates that the La Mojarra language may have fewer signs than Maya, and may thus represent an even more phonetic, less logographic system. But unless many more carved stones are found in Veracruz, the glyphs will probably never be read.

4\. Close with a call to action or a dramatic or strong statement

a. In persuasive essays, writers often ask readers to take action. You can conclude with a call to action in different types of compositions as well. In an essay that urges people to conserve fuel, the author ended in this way.

b. ….It is our earth and our air and our ozone layer. And it is the pollution from our vehicles

that is destroying them. We must change our ways now.

5\. End with an appropriate quotation

a. You can use a quotation that sums up your main point or that is attention grabbing, as long as it fits the essay topic.

6\. End with a thought provoking question

a. You can use a question the will force the reader to think fore deeply about your topic or its significance or solution.\\

7\. Framing Technique: refer to the introduction

a. You can frame your essay by mentioning something in your attention-getting device and ending with the same topic. Notice how the one final sentence of the conclusion works with the introduction to “frame” the essay.

b. Introduction: The “labs” are really just a single room filled with equipment: computers, machine-shop tools, boxes full of ragged maps, flutes, a wooden recorder. In the middle of it all sits what looks like the mutant spawn of a bicycle crossed with a computer. Roughly speaking, that is what it is – a fully self-sufficient, solar-powered bicycle incorporating the most advanced computer technology available – and it answers to the name Behemoth.

c. Conclusion:It is going to be another late night in the “lab” in the back of

Building Four.

**The Conclusion - another approach**

· Part I

o Use the first half of the introduction to focus on your side. The focus on your side will further sway your reader to agree with your argument.

· Part II

o For the second half of the conclusion, I want you to use a concluding device or concluding strategy and to develop it fully to end the paper with a sense of closure. You will want to use this strategy (device) to reflect further on your position.

o Concluding Strategies (Devices)

§ Call to action

· Ask your reader to get involved in the issue in some way. You might, for example, ask them to write a congressmen, be more vigilant, become better educated, support a movement….

Whatever your call to action, please be as specific and as full as possible with your explanations and advice.

§ Explain significance or importance or consequences of the issue

· You might end by discussing the possible consequences of the issue or how the issue is very important. By doing so, you are implying that a solution can and should be reached soon.

§ Apply to modern day example or times

· You might, for instance, think of an example that involves a similar issue and explain your topic in relation to the newer example.

§ You may offer a solution to the issue or problem

· You might want to explain in more detail ways to solve the issue or main idea of your paper.

**Final Advice:**

· You do want to focus on your topic in the conclusion, and you might offer additional information. Try to avoid introducing new ideas, however, in the conclusion, for you have to prepare the reader for the ending. You do not want to introduce too much new material and surprise the reader.\\

· Be aware how you begin and end your essays and try to vary your approach; it might not be wise to begin and end with a question in the same essay, for instance.

**Exercise: Analyzing an Introduction and Its Conclusion**

Directions:

1\. Read the following paragraphs and answer the following questions:

a. Explain how the author connects his introduction with the conclusion.

b. Explain how the author constructs his conclusion for the essay.

**Sample Introduction**

Seventeen-year-old Wyatt Pierce attends high school in a very small town in Oregon, but through classroom computers, he access to a much wider world. He can see the most current maps, browse through the on-line catalog of the state library, and even design shelves for the ranch where he lives. Computers have brought new dimensions to classrooms everywhere by opening up worlds of information and help for students and teachers, but they are not without problems.

**Sample Conclusion**

No one doubts that computers in the classroom are here to stay. They open doors into vast new worlds, and students and teachers can benefit from them enormously. Concerns about classroom computer use are real, but they are minor compared with the benefits computers offer. Don Johnson, who teaches both English and computers, sums up the advantages of computers in this way: “Computers are the most valuable tool to be introduced into the classroom in the last two hundred years. They remove the walls and allow students and teachers to expand the learning experience far beyond the limits of the classroom.”

· You might be able to apply the issue or your argument to a similar modern issue and use the device to make an additional point for your argument.

§ Explain some sort of compromise or solution(s)

· You can end by explaining possible solutions, especially if the solutions support your argument.

§ Frame

· Develop a connection to the introductory strategy.
