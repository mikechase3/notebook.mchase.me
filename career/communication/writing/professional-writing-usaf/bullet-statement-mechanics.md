# Bullet Statement Mechanics

## Getting Started

* **Get Organized**: keep a record of accomplishments/awards/recommendations for people I supervise and make regular entries in everyone's folder.
* **Write Effectively**:
  * Get the reader's attention.
  * Positive words & phrases leave a lasting impression.
  * Neutral/negative give the impression that the person you're writing about is below average.

## Drafting Bullet Statements

### Step 1: Extract the Facts

* Write down facts.
* Keep a file of accomplishments.

#### Gather Information

* **Isolate the action**: Isolate and record the specific action the person performed.
* **Annotate the record**: Mark the action with a power verb that best describes the action (e.g., repaired, installed, designed, etc.)
* **Measure the action**: document related numerical information (number of items fixed, dollars saved, man-hours expended, people served, pages written, etc.)
* **Connect the dots**: document how the accomplishments and the broader mission of the unit, group, wing, installation, command, or Air Force.
* **Ask the member**: talk to the people you supervise. They can clarify information on the tasks they perform, provide details about what they accomplished, and inform you on how the task was done (e.g. saving time, treasure, or talent).
* **Ask others and check the tech**: consult technical orders, customers served, letters of appreciation, automated work production documents or other sources to get all the information you need.
* **Capture from the start**: track subordinate's accomplishments as they happen.

#### Sorting Information

* Sort into what is useful and not useful.
* Test each item to see if it s truly associated with the accomplishment I identified earlier.
* "Is this bit of information solidly connected to this single accomplishment?"

### Step 2: Build Structure

The second step is to make it into an "accomplishment-impact bullet." **Group the sorted items for each accomplishment as either the accomplishment (the what) or the impact (who, when, how, why)**.

#### The Accomplishment Element

* **Action:** is the first accomplishment element. Action is best expressed with strong action verbs.

* **Adverbs** modify the action \*\*\*\* verb. Connect $$adverb + verb = magic$$.

#### **The Impact Element (Impact and Results)**

The impact element explains how the person's actions had an effect on the organization. The scope should be consistent with the person's accomplishments.

### Step 3: Streamline the Final Product

* **Review:** so far, we separated the accomplishment and impact elements and joined the two and applied standards to make them meaningful. Now, streamline the bullet to keep it concise.

#### Accuracy

* If facts are stretched, exaggerated, or embellished, then accuracy is lost.
* Exaggeration or embellishment, no matter how minor, is not the truth.
* Evaluations, appraisals, awards, and decorations are permanent official records. Let them be full of facts and truth that reflects our core values.

#### Brevity

* Choose clear and easy yet descriptive words for readers.
* Eliminate or reduce unnecessary words.

> **Words to Eliminate:**
>
> * Articles: a, an, the
> * Helping verbs: can, could, may, might, must, ought, shall, should, will, would
> *   Also forms of be, have, and do
>
>     o Forms of be: be, am, is, are, was, were, been, being o Forms of have: have, has, had, having\
>     o Forms of do: do, does, did
> * Linking verbs: forms of verbs associated with five senses: look, sound, smell, feel, taste
> * Name of the person when their name is printed elsewhere on the document
> * Personal pronouns
> * Prepositions (use them sparingly): over, under, in, during, within, etc.

#### Specificity

* Contain detailed facts.
* To write them, you'll need to be familiar with the people and systems involved.
* Resist the urge to estimate or generalize.
* Don't be satisfied with a range or round numbers. Get the exact numbers and use them.

## Polishing Statements

### Accuracy

Imagine you see a notable bullet point on someone's impact statement:

> Repaired 17 seriously corroded broken or missing Log Periodic (LP) antenna elements in the Atlantic Gateway Antenna System within 3 days by using elements from decommissioned antenna parts saving an estimated $3500 in procurement cost and 4 weeks of expected delivery time

How would you check the accuracy? Here's a few probing questions that reveal a more detailed picture of the actual accomplishment:

* How many antenna elements were actually repaired?
* How many were replaced?
* How long does delivery really take and why?
* Four weeks of delivery time seems like a long time; why does it take so long to receive antenna parts?

### Specificity

## Guidance on WARs

From analyzing a few examples, you discover a pattern. To write a good WAR, just follow this pattern:

1. Successfully + \<Action Verb> + something and why that was necessary (e.g. to optimize company's product).
2. Describe what you did with men, labor hours, and how it plays into a larger role within AFRL. If it's research, use your sentence to explain what the hypothesis was and how it was tested.
3. Explain
