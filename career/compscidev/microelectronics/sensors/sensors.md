# Sensors
Understanding and integrating sensors is crucial for applications such as building autonomous rovers.

## Types of Sensors

### Environmental Sensors
* Humidity and Temperature Sensors: DHT11, DHT22.
* Air Quality Sensors: MQ-X series.
* Pressure Sensors: BMP180, BMP280.

### Motion & Position Sensors
* Accelerometers: ADXL335, MPU-6050.
* Gyroscopes: L3GD20H.
* GPS Modules: NEO-6M.



### Optical Sensors
* Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs): Simple light sensors.
* Infrared (IR) Sensors: For proximity sensing and distance measurement.
* Camera Modules: For image capture and processing.
* [Photospectrometers and Colorimeters](https://www.linquip.com/blog/difference-between-colorimeter-and-spectrophotometer/): Used for color detection and light analysis.
