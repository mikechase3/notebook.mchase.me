# Quantum Computing

## Parts of an Electron

Electrons are described by four quantum numbers.

1. Principal Quantum Number (energy level)
2. Azimuthal Quantum Number (orbital shape)
3. Magnetic Quatum Number (orbital orientation)
4. Spin Quantum Number (angular momentum/spin)

## Fundamental Particles of an Atom

Before diving in, let's discuss these.

* **Protons**: these are positively charged particles. Located in the nucleus (center). This defines the element.
* **Neutrons**: these are neutral particles (no charge) and are also found in the nucleus. They contribute to the atom's mass and stability.
* **Electrons**: these are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in shells or energy levels. They're involved in chemical bonding & determine the atom's reactivity.
* **Quarks**: fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons.
* **Leptons**: a family of particles that includes electrons and neutrinos.
* **Bosons**: force-carryinhg particles, like photons (light particles) and gluons (which hold quarks together).

### Isotopes & Changing Subatomic Structures

Isitopes are atoms of the same element that have a different number of neutrons. Since the number of protons defines an element, isotopes have the same atomoic number (number of protons), but different mass numbers (total number of protons and neutrons).

#### Altering Neutrons

When you alter neutrons, it creates different isitopes of that element as described above. Some isitopes are stable while others are radioactive and decay over time.

**Applications**

* Radioactive isotopes are used in medicine for imaging.
* Also used in industry for tracing & dating.

#### Altering Electrons

* Adding or removing electrons from an atom creates ions.
* Ions are charged particles?
* Ions are crucial for many chemical reactions & biological processes.
* Example: electrolytes in batteries, nerve signals in our bodies, and many industrial processes.

#### Altering Protons

* This transforms an atom into a new element entirely.
* This is the fundamental principle of nuclear transmutation.
* Transmutation is used in nuclear reactors to create new elements and isitopes.

#### Altering Quarks

* Quarks are fundamental building blocks of protons and neutrons.
* You can change the arrangement of quarks within a proton or neutron.
* Changing it results in creation of expotic particles like hyperons or delta baryons.
* These particles are studied to understand the fundamental forces of nature.

#### Leptons

* These are fundamental particles that don't experience the strong nuclear force.
* Changing the number of leptons in a system can affect its ovrall charge and energy.
* Lepton interactions are studied in particle physics experiments.

#### Bsons

* These are force-carrying particles
* Changing the number or energy of bosons can alter interactions between particles
* Potentially leads to new states of matter or exotic phenomena.
* These are studied in high-energy physics experiments.

## Properties of Electrons

### Cathode Ray Tube Experiment

* **Discovery of the Electron**: JJ thompson discovered it in 1897 through experiments with cathode rays. He realized tthe rays are composed o negatively charged particles smaller than atoms.
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6zyPOSreCg)
* Inside the cathode ray tube, we have like 0.01 pascals. 1atm is 101,325 pascals.
* If the pressure is too high, collisions with gas particles will screw up the experiment.
* Inside the cathode ray tube, there's a:
  * Cathod: a negatively charged electrodes.
  * Anode: a positively charged electrodes.
* When a cathode is heated and if a high voltage is applied between the cathode & anode, an electron beam will accelerate towards the anode.
* The glass of the chamber is coated with zinc sulfide so when they hit the glass, it creates a green glow. (These are very useful in making TVs)
  * When it strikes the image, it'll produce an image based on the voltage.
* The electron beam appears to eminate from the cathode, not the anode so it's called the cathode ray experiment not the anode ray experiment.
* How did JJ Thompson ddetermine it consisted of negatively particles?
  * A magnet will deflect moving charges. It won't deflect stationary charges. Therefore, it'll be affected by a magnet.
  * Therefore, the beam would also be deflected opposite of the magnet.
* Therefore, the beam is negative as it opposes the magnet.
* No matter if you use aluminum, copper, silver... all of these can emit a cathode ray.
  * Therefore, everything is composed of electrons.
* **Calculating charge to mass ratio**: he got a number too! If we have a positive/negative plates, the electron will fill a force that'll attract and repel. Therefore, **electrons can be accelerated by magnetic/electric fields**. That'll cause an electron to change direction and deflect it.
  * By calculatiing the radius of curvature and the drift, you can calculate the charge to mass ratio.
  * Any force that causes it to move in a circle is a centripetal force Fc=mv^2/R and F\_b = Bqv.
    * R is the radius curviture.
    * b is strength of the magnetic field.
  * F\_b = B (measured in units of tesla) \* q (charge of the electron) \* V (velocity of electron).
  * **Centripetal Force**: caused by another force that causes it to go in a circle. Like graviy provides a centripetal force on the moon. F\_c=mv^2/R.
    * Bq = mv/R (m is mass, v is velocity, R is radius of curvature).
    * To get charge to mass ratio, derive to q/m = V/B\*R. (q is charge, b is strength of magnetic field which we can change).
    * Measuring the speed of an eelctron is hard to do, so we remove it from the equation.
    * The electric field F\_e = q\*E & F\_b=BqV. We can set them equal and cancel them out? Therefore v=E/B if we design the experiment such that F\_b and F\_e arfe equal.
  * Make the magnetic force cancel the electric force and things work out nicely.
    * Two plates. One is poositive charge and other is negative and electron beam goes to the right. A positively charged particle will feel a foce going in the direction of the electric field. A negativelty charged one goes in the opposite/other directino opposite of the electric field going to the positive plate. So the electrons in the beam wanna deviate towards the positive plate due to the electric forces acting on it.
  * Using the right hand rule, you can determine the force and charge/mass ratio.
* The charge of an electric thingy q/m=-1.76\*10^8 c/g.
* q\_c/m = 1.602\*10^-19c / 9.11 \* 10^-8

### Sublevels of Electrons

* In energy level 1, there's sublevel `s`. S has one bed & one orbital.
* Level 2: s, p
* Level 3: s, p, d (three orbitals)
* Level 4: s, p, d, f (four orbitals). (14 electrons can be stored in `f`).

In the periodic table, the first two columns are `S`, then D`, and` P\`

## Quantum Entanglement

When one electron is spinning up, the other is spinning down. Always.

### Quantum Numbers

1. Principal quantum number (n): this describes the electron's energy level. It can be any positive integer with higher numbers indicating higher energy levels. Think circles around the center.
2. Angular momentum quantum number (I): defines the shape of the electron's orbital. It ranges from 0 to n-1 with 0 corresponding to a spherical s orbital, 1 to a dumbell-shaped p orbital, and so on.
   * Learn more about energy levels in chem.libretexts.org 5.12: "Energy Level"
3. **Magnetic Quantum Number (ml)**: specifies the orientation of the orbital in space. I can take on values from -1 to 1 including zero.
4. Spin quantum number (ms) represents the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron which is quantized and has a value of +1/2 to -1/2. This is referred to as **spin up/down**.

#### To Read

Entanglement and Secure Communication Entanglement: Definition: Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon where two or more particles become linked, sharing the same fate regardless of the distance between them. Measuring the state of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the state of the other, even if they are light-years apart. Secure Communication: Entanglement can be used for secure communication because any attempt to eavesdrop on the entangled particles would disrupt their state, alerting the sender and receiver. Hypothetical System: Generating Entangled Pairs: A source would generate pairs of entangled electrons, each sent to the sender and receiver. Encoding Information: The sender would manipulate the spin state of their electron to encode information (e.g., spin up for 1, spin down for 0). Decoding Information: The receiver would measure the spin of their entangled electron, instantly knowing the state of the sender's electron and thus the encoded information. Eavesdropping Detection: Any attempt to intercept the entangled electrons would alter their state, making the communication unreliable and alerting the sender and receiver. Challenges: Maintaining Entanglement: Entanglement is fragile and susceptible to environmental noise. Maintaining entanglement over long distances is a significant challenge. Scalability: Scaling up entangled communication systems for practical applications is complex and requires further research. Morse Code Machine Design Components: Power Source: Battery or AC adapter. Key: A switch to open and close the circuit. Sounder: A device that produces audible clicks when the circuit is closed. Wiring: Copper wire to connect the components. Enclosure: A box to house the components. Function: Pressing the key closes the circuit, activating the sounder and producing a "dot" sound. Holding the key down for a longer duration produces a "dash" sound. Different combinations of dots and dashes represent letters and numbers in Morse code. Design: The key could be a simple push button or a lever-based switch. The sounder could be a simple electromagnetic device or a more sophisticated speaker system. The enclosure could be made of wood, metal, or plastic, depending on the desired aesthetics and durability. Note: This is a simplified design. Real Morse code machines are more complex and may include features like a keyer for faster transmission, a code book for reference, and a receiver for decoding incoming signals. Further Research: For more information on entanglement and its applications in secure communication, search for "quantum cryptography" and "entanglement-based communication." For detailed designs of Morse code machines, search for "Morse code keyer" and "Morse code sounder."
