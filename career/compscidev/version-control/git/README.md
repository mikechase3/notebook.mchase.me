## Introduction

* Git is a version control system
*

## Common Commands

* `git init` creates a new Git repository
* `git status` inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
* `git add` adds files from the working directory to the staging area
* `git diff` shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
* `git commit` permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
* `git log` shows a list of all previous commits

## Standard Conventions

### Git Messages

* Written in the past tense.
* Brief, 50 characters or less.

## Getting started

* Checkout [this](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/computer-science/tracks/cspath-development-skills/modules/learn-git-git-workflow-u/articles/f1-u3-git-setup) article for how to get started with git and Github
* It's focused on syncing, not the commands or anything.
* There are also some [videos](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/computer-science/tracks/cspath-development-skills/modules/learn-git-git-workflow-u/articles/getting-started-git-and-github) which might be helpful.

## Work Cited

* Codecademy's bash/terminal course. There's a [cheatsheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science/tracks/cspath-development-skills/modules/learn-git-git-workflow-u/cheatsheet) too - though I don't think it's that good.
