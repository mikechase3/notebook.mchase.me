# Workstation Standard Libary

Standard practices for my Windows workstations. One day I'll sort by importance/relavance.

## Useful Resourcese

* [Ninite](https://ninite.com) provides easy software installation.
* [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/directory/windows/) for open source software

## Mandatory Apps

During installation of stuff, disable windows search indexing. Run `services.msc` & stop/suspend it.

1. Process Hacker - view more details about what's eaing up all your CPU.
