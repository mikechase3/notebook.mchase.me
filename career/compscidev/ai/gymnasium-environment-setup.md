# Gymnasium Environment Setup

## What is Gemnasium?

Gemnasium is a way to practice & hone in on my AI skills. It's meant for visual learners.

Here are some examples:

## Setup with PyCharm

Their website says that they're now "gemnasium" not "gym", but in my searching I think we're still supposed to use gym at the time I'm writing this. So ignore this part of the website:

I found out the hard way by trying to get sub-packages. I'm not 100% sure why the&#x20;

### Quotes Matter

Apparently this is an open issue.&#x20;

### Dealing with Swig Issues

I had to uninstall swig `pip3 uninstall swig`, then install it through homebrew `brew install swig`.&#x20;

### Now What?

```
pip install 'gym[box2d]'
```

### Reinstall Python Apparently

> The error message indicates that the pygame package failed to install because it couldn't find the longintrepr.h file. This file is part of the Python development headers, which are needed to compile some Python packages from source. You can install the Python development headers by installing the python-dev package. However, on macOS, these headers should be included with the Python installation from Homebrew. If you installed Python from another source, you might need to reinstall it using Homebrew:

### Conda

Next download this thing

And install it of course. It takes more than a minute.

I couldn't get it activated:
