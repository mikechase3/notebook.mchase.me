## Useful Resources
* Definitely recommend starting with [oh my git](https://ohmygit.org/).
* A [git cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
* [Mastering Git](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/mastering-git\)

Also, be sure to find articles about how it's integrated with your IDE:
* Gaming engines like UE5 support git but have other systems.
* Jetbrains, Visual Studio, and basically everyone integrates with it.
* Use Github Desktop or Source Tree for a GUI that'll *help*, but I wouldn't rely on it.
