* Best practices and what is new with i[n-app purchases](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/704/)
* Four [pleasures of gaming](https://famousaspect.com/understanding-f2p-with-the-four-pleasures-model/)
* Making games [fun](http://buildnewgames.com/making-games-fun/)
* [Classic Game Postmortem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIaK6y5kdro) (Populus). Discovering the fun
* Sense and nonsense about [video game addiction](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201803/sense-and-nonsense-about-video-game-addiction)
* Ten things [every game needs](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/ten-things-every-game-needs-part-1-part-2-2011-12-19). (Yeah - clickbait but it's a good read)
