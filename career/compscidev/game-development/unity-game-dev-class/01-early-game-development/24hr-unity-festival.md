## Hour 1: Introduction

* Unity is free up to 100K in revenue.
* **Template:** doesn't matter. The options just control editor settings. High Definition RP and Universal Renderer pipeline are part of Unity's scriptable rendering pipeline which is too complicated for this lesson.
* **Reset Views:**  reset views quickly by going to Window -> Layouts -> Default layouts.
* **Switch Layouts**: change on the fly with the dropdown on the top right.
* **Assets**: all textures, sounds, files are assets.
* **Game Objects:** an object part of a scene or level.
* **Packages**: are add-ons. You can purchase/download some [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/account/assets). You can make your own too. Maybe I'll do that later.
* **Organization:** Give every asset type (scenes, scripts, textures, etc) its own folder. Place every asset in a folder. Folders should become more specific and not vague/generalized
*
