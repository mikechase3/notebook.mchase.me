### Storytelling Traditions
The start of visual storytelling traces its roots back
to "cave paintings", where were flat, 2D images that 
told simple stories without words or sound.

* Evolution of visual media: film/tv/entertainmetn
* Games & Visual Storytellling: revolutionizing how stories are told

### Generating Ideas
* **Write what you know**: creates fantasy, science fiction, more.
* **Draw inspiration from everyday life**: observations of people, surroudings, dreams.
* **Personal Experience as inspiration**: 
* **Inspiration from existing stories**: 

LA Noire with black dolly murders from 1940s are largely unsolved
and that's a game.

#### Adaptating Existing Works for Games
* Inspiration from existing media:
* Direct adaptations and legal considerations:
* Successful game adaptations

(Aparently South Park Stick of Truth is Amazing)

* Alien Isolation is also showed & is a good game.
* God of War

### Case Study - Marianne Krawczyk
She wrote for TV shows like Bratz and Sweet Valley High.
Developed animated projects but transitioned to video game
wriitng. 

Some challenes of game writing:
* Requires engaging twists, truthful characters, compelling words
* Integrating story with gameplay presents unique challenge as games aren't
linear, while good stories often follow linear structures.

Game of Thrones has so many point of views, but the story
flows in a pre-defined way and everyone watches it.

### Psychology Behind Storytelling
* Psychologist Carl Jung explains it in terms of the "collective unconscious":
  We are all born with and yet can never be directly conscious of. (IMPT)
* **Universial Archetypes**: ?
* **Enhancing connection**: ? 

## Character Archtypes
### The Hero
* **The Hero**: the central character, and the player takes on this role,
  creating a strong connection and identification with the character.
* **Hero's Journey and Anti-Heros**: go through a major transformation.
* How you behave & conduct yourself determines if you're heroic. 

Examples of game heros in games:
* Uncharted (Nathan Drake)
* Tomb Raider (Lara Croft)
* Legend of Zelda (Link)
* Resident Evil (Leon Kennedy)
* Metroid (Samus Aran)

### The Shadow
Shadow is the hero's opposite, often the ultimate evil,
and is someonetimes responsible for the hero's problem. This character
may remain hidden until the climax, adding dramatic tension.

Examples: 
* Wario
* Black Knight: Shovel Knight.
* Ganon or Ganondorf are the examples in Zelda.

### Mentor
* Basically mentors the hero.
* Wisdom, past experiences, advisor, helps 'em take action.

Examples in Games:
* Sargeant Major Avery Junior Johnson (Halo)
* David Anderson (Mass Effect)
* Vesemir (The Witcher)
* Duncan (Dragon Age)
* Johnny Silverhand (Cyberpunk 2077)
* Final Fantasy 10 - what a jerk mentor.
* Auron (Final Fantasy X)

### The Ally

* Helps with tasks too challenging to accomplish alone.
* May be close companions or peripheral characters
  offering support when needed.

proven their worth, often testing the hero's abilities or resolve.

* nicole Brennan (Dead Space)
* Robert & Rosalind Letece (Bioshock Infinite)

* Princess Zelda
* Virgil in Dante's Inferno
* Barney Calhoun (Half-Life)
* Eno Cordova (Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order)

### The Protagonist
* Difference between them and a hero is the ability
  to not always chose the best path forward.
* They might have a flaw. 
* Often aligned with the Jungian hero archetype.
* Story centers around their actions/decisions/growth.

* Vaas Montenegro (Far Cry 3)
* SHODAN (System Shock 2)
* Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)
* Andrew Ryan (Bioshock)
* The Illusive Man (Mass Effect 2 & 3)

2. Alex Mercer in Prototype
3. Arthas Menethil (Warcraft)
4. Sarah Kerrigan (Starcraft)
5. Haytham Kenway (Assassin's Creed III)

### Mistaken Protagonist
Professor Snape would be a fake antagonist.
There's typically a really redeeming quality in them.

### Exaggerated Antagonist

### Co Protagonists
They jjoin forces with the protagonist, often working together
to overcome greater challenges. These characters are common
in team-based games.

### Supporting Characters
Also known as pivotal characters, exist to prevent the protagonist
from walking away from the central problem. 

Often jump-start the action, working on behalf of either the protagonist
or antagonist.

Examples:
* Big Daddies & Little Sisters in Bioshock
* Nick Valentine (Fallout 4)
* Charles Smith (Red Red Redemption 2)


## Story Structure
### Lecture Summary: Creating the Narrative - Story Structure

#### Overview
This lecture focuses on the unique elements of storytelling within games, contrasting them with traditional narrative forms. By the end of the session, students will be equipped to:

- Identify and understand the key differences in story elements between games and other media.
- Analyze how these differences affect player experience and engagement. 

Key topics covered will include the structure of narratives in games, including character development, plot progression, and player choices, as well as the implications of interactive storytelling.

### Terminology and Key Points on Story Structure

#### Key Terminology:
- **Jungian Archetypes**: Fundamental, universal symbols and themes that resonate with human experience, often used in character development and narrative structures.
- **Monomyth (Heroâ€™s Journey)**: Joseph Campbell's concept of a universal narrative structure common in many stories, detailing stages such as the Call to Adventure, Tests, and the Return.
- **Three-Act Structure**: A traditional narrative framework that divides a story into Setup, Confrontation, and Resolution.
- **Five-Act Structure**: An extended narrative structure that includes Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, and Denouement.
- **Non-linear Storytelling**: A narrative style where events are not presented in chronological order, allowing for flashbacks, parallel storylines, or player-driven progression.

#### Major Points on Types of Story Structure:
- **Linear Structure**: A straightforward approach where the story advances in a single direction from beginning to end.
- **Branching Structure**: A format where player choices lead to different outcomes and story paths, providing a sense of agency.
- **Open World Structure**: A narrative design that allows players to explore and interact with a world at their own pace, with stories emerging from exploration.
- **Episodic Structure**: A series of self-contained stories that contribute to a larger narrative arc, often seen in games with multiple chapters or episodes.
- **Character-Centric Structure**: Focuses on character development and personal arcs, emphasizing emotional journeys alongside plot progression. 

These concepts provide a foundation for understanding how narratives are constructed within games and how they may differ from traditional storytelling methods.
