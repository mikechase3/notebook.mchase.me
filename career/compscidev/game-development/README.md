# Game Development

## Roadmap

There's a lot in game engines. Suggest peeking at this roadmap as it provides a nice overview rather than picking a game engine and just going at it. [Github](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap). Site: [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)

## Important-ish Games

* Ocraiina of time

## Class Midterm

* Course is called "Game Design & Development"
* He's going to separate core content from technical?
* 40% game design document, 30% technical, 30% core context.

### Technical - how are we making games?

* `export` shows a defined variable.
* `CollisionShape`: Makes hitbox type thigns.

#### Timeline?

If he gives us a timeline, say over 1 second, make it change colors and make a gradient.

* I definitely need to read the book & make the game.
* We supposedly finished it recently.
* He likes this question now, it's great.

#### Core Content

**Chatper 1 - Arcades**

* **Firsts** are a big deal - like exidy's death race.
  * Gremlins - we ran over gremlins.
  * It was the first game to be controversial because of violence.
* Atari's asteroids 1979 is super similar to space-rocks.
  * First for vector graphics
  * First to enter a high-score.
* Galaxian, Pacman, Mario, Something similar to CoinDash, PolePos.

**Ch2**

* **Adventure** in 1980: Warren Robinett.
  * "Which game recognizes having the first developer introduce easter egg"
  * "Adventure" is the answer.
* OneTwoThreeFour.a
* **Companies**: which did not produce a console in (time window, frame)
  * Sega, nintendo, microsoft (not in the 1990s though), sony.

**CH3**

PCs

#### CH4 - Platforms and player code

* **Netcode**: what is this? know it.
* What kind of video game (describe it)

## Review

### Difference between B2B and B2C Business Model

* Deeloping for a computing platform provides more flexibility with hardware/software but is harder to ensure compatibility across different systems.
* Developing for consoles offers a consistent hardware setup, making optimization easier, but has limitations.

### Hero's Journey

* Most people crushed that question and someone drew the hurculean cycle.
