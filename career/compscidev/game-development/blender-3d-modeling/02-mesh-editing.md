# 02: Mesh Editing

**Applying Scales**: Object => Apply => Scale to make your new object's scale have `{1,1,1}`.

### Smooth Shading

* `<Select Object> => Context Menu => Shade Smooth`: You can make objects appear to be smooth without affecting it's geometry.
* You can confirm whether something is high or low poly by looking at the _silhouette_.

### Subdivision Surface

Notice that even though we turned on smooth surface, the silhouette is still jagged:

The "subsurf" modifier adds exponential amounts of detail. This makes it look nicer, but slows down render times.

To fix the rough silhouette, you'll use the `subdivision surface` tool. This is in the `modifier panel` ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (717).png>)

## Changing Display Modifier Visibility

* Modifiers make blender slow.
* To temporarily skip rendering:
  * During editing (when you hit \<num 1>), use ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (662).png>)
  * In viewport ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (664).png>)
  * In renderer: right camera-looking button: ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (655).png>)

## Editing Vertices

### Editing a Vertex

* Press `1` to edit vertices individually.
* You can drag out each vertex individually
* You can select multiple vertices by holding `shift`.

### Proportional Editing ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (651) (1) (1).png>)

#### Edit Mode #`1`

![You can control the proportion between each vertex. Default is smooth.](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (645) (1) (3).png>)

* To edit the influence radius, hold the left mouse button down while performing the transform operation and scroll up/down on the mouse.

Spent an hour figuring this out :turtle:

You can also proportion size here:
