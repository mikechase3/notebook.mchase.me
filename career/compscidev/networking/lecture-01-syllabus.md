### Part 2

* Use a loop to process 100 URLs.
* Given a URL, build a request.
  * Use a socket to send the request to a remote server.
  * After we send this _GET_ request, you'll get a reply.
* `RECV` function call receives data and stores it into a string.
  * You can parse the string and do some nice data analysis.
  *

### Part 3: Multithreading

* Call 1M URLs using 3500 threads.
* Use `Mutek` to lock and unlock threads.
* Create 3500 threads to process.
* Use `mutex` to lock and unlock threads.
