## Asynchronous Motivation Examples

* Live results without refreshing the web page (ie. new email in gmail).
* These are based on Ajax (which Ajax is based on Asynchronous Javascript and XML)

![Browser must send a request to a server triggered by an event.](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (457).png>)

## HTTP Limitations

* Designed for document transfer w/ a request-response interaction.
* Bi-directional, but still half-duplex. The traffic flows in only one direction at a time.
* Stateless
  * There is a lot of extra overhead. Has to send the cookie every-time.
* Websockets, by contrast to half-duplex, can run without requests from the client.

### Ajax and Real-Time Communications

* Ajax can be used as nearly real-time communications.
  * XMLHTTPRequest is sent at regular time intervals.

### APIs

| Function              |                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| onopen                | Successfully connected to the server            |
| onerror               | An error occurs                                 |
| onclose               |                                                 |
| onmessage             | When the client receives a message from server. |
| myWebSocket.send(msg) | Sends a message.                                |

### Server-Side Programming

* A WebSocket server is a TCP application listening on any port.
  * It follows the WebSocket protocol.

#### Libraries

* `websocket.io` , `socket.io (Node.js)`, `Apache-websocket`, `PHP Websocket`, `JavaWebSocket` are all libraries that implement these features.
