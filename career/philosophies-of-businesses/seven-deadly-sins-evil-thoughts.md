# Seven Deadly Sins (Evil Thoughts)

## Sloth

What strategies can we use to differentiate between the sin of sloth & other similar behaviors that might `virtue[patience, deliberateness, caution, equanimity]`.&#x20;

* Virtuous misconceptions.
  * Deliberate, smooth patient approaches most would call virtuous.&#x20;
  * Not the same as being thoughtful or reflective.
* Actual Slothy Behaviors
  * Staying on the couch, excessive drinking/smoking/sleeping.
  * You know it's not the best thing to do, but we **cave to that** even when I know I should get started on my work or book a vacation.
  * A lack of care for spiritual duties.&#x20;
  * Quitting in the middle
    * Life gets hard; you can't quit.
    * Don't have the stamina.
    * Quitting out of laziness.
* Opposite of sloth?
  * Many, many people led lives of brutally hard work, often bordering on or fully involved in slavery essentially.
  * So does this mean work for our corporate/government overlords?&#x20;
    * Work very hard because it's a service to God?&#x20;
    * Use a little guilt to make you do the work & make you feel like you're a loser if you don't.&#x20;
  * Hyper-productivity & always be working towards some goal without considering the value of that goal.
* Thomas Schelling, the 2005 Nobel Laureate in economics, he won his Nobel Prize.&#x20;
  * Fascinated w/ self-control&#x20;
  * Struggled to quit smoking.&#x20;
  * Game between your present self & your future self.&#x20;
  * You ahve to play tricks on the self you're going to be when you're going to cave into temptation.&#x20;
* Commitment Devices
  * Right now, I don't think I should smoke, so right now, I'm going to throw out al these cigarettes.
  * Right now, I'm goign to put fruit out on the table & remove all the junk food from my house.
  * Basically use propaganda to motivate yourself.
  * Compete between oursleves and something/someone else.
* Aspects of Self-Control
  * People are good at certain elements. (e.g. fiscal responsibility cause I'm cheap)
  * But then act poorly about other elements (e.g. laziness in cleaning my condo)
* Survey Questions
  * I avoid physical exercise.
    * I hate it too, but found many ways to get it done; some I enjoy more than others.
  * I procrastinate.
  * I quit when I'm frustrated.
  * I avoid hard work.
  * Score: minimally impulsive <--> maximally impulsive.
  * I don't workout/walk as much as I should.
  * Am I undermining my future wellbeing by maximizing my present wellbeing? Something reflective or less 'fun' isn't thrilling.

> _DUBNER: He was a busy fella, but this is from an essay called “In Praise of Idleness.” He wrote, “A great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by belief in the virtuousness of work. And the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work. Without a considerable amount of leisure, a man is cut off from many of the best things” and he goes on to distinguish between positive idleness and negative idleness._
