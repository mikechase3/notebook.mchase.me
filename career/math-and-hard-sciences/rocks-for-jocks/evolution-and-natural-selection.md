# Evolution & Natural Selection

## Intro to Darwinian Evolution

For a long time, people predicted that birds were related to dinosaurs. Much later on, they found that dinosaurs had feathers too confirming that they were related.

#### Darwin's Descent with Modification Highlights:

1. Organisms have a genealogy: are all related in ancestor descendant relationships
2. Organisms have change over time.&#x20;

### Facts vs Theory

* Facts: observable & experimental data.
* Theory: a system of ideas to explain the factual data.

## Theories

### Organic Evolution & Lamarack

* He believed that if your body wanted something bad enough, it'll happen.
* If a giraffee sees really rich stuff, it'll stretch its neck to try and reach it out over and over and over again. Over the course of that adult's life, it'll grow 3 inches.
* Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) was all like "that adult's neck that grew 3 inches will be passed to it's kids" which is wrong.

### Charles Darwin & Natural Selection

(1859; Lived 1809-1882)

He's a student of Adam Sedgwick at Cambridge. He was the dining companion of Captain Fitzroy, and later the ships naturalist. The captain does not communicate with the grew except to give orders. He reads Charles Lyell's principles of Geology and uniformitarianism  during the 5-year voyage. Through read Malthus realized that more offspring are born than can possibly survive. Also through raising pigeons understod vafriation and what breeders accomplish trhough artifical selection. Nature can also select for favorable traits.

#### Voyage of Beagle & Galapagos Islands

There was some turtle. There was a turtle named George. George was the last of his species and finally died. Darwin believed there was a harsh struggle for existence. Nature sorts through and picks the most favorable experienced abilities that made it easier to survive and reproduce. This was also called "Darwin's Demon" because they didn't like the idea of God's world being a harsh place where people had to kill each other to access resources. Then there are these stories of victorian women having tea and saying "have you heard the theory of Darwin's Natural Selection" and them being "yeah, let's hope that doesn't get around."

### Theories of Evolution Must Answer:

1. How does evolutionary change occur? What is the origin of new characters?
2. Why does evolutionary change occur? What is it's driving mechanism?
3. How is change transmitted over time?
4. How does change over time lead to adaptation?

Charles Darwin attempted to answer these questions in his book "On the Origin of Species", published in 1859 and revolutionizes biology.

#### Darwin & Variation

* Variation: Darwin says organisms vary.
* Heredity: The variation is passed to offspring
* Fitness: expectation of reproductive success. The likelihood that you'll pass your genes on to a large amount of offspring. You could be the biggest/fastest T-rex and a tree falls on you. So it's the expectation of reproduction.

These 3 can produce differential success, but not adaptation. The key to adaption lies in the 4th observation:

**Superfecundity (the 4th):** is that having too many offspring in a limited space have to fight to survive. This struggle pushes organisms to be better, have more offspring, and use stuff effectively. This all leads to adaptive evolution which is the basis for Darwin's theory of natural selection.

### Variation

Mutation occurs randomly. None of them occur because you want them to, but the DNA variation is random. Here are 2 reasons why variation occurs:

* Genetic Mutation
* Sexual recombination

**Evolution**: sorting of random variation by deterministic process: natural selection.
