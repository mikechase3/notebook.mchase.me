# Plate Tectonics

## Goals

Be able to answer & explain early attempts to explain:

* How do mountains form?
* Why are they often along continental margins?
* What causes earthquakes and volcanoes?
* Why are they often in linear chains?

## How do Mountains Form?

### Edward Suess & James Dana (Late 1800s)

* Two geologists in the late 1800s, _Edward Suess and James Dana_ thought the earth started off as hot and as it cooled, it shrank.
* If you think of an apple that dries out, shrinks, and wrinkles, these geologists thought the earth was shrinking & wrinkling.
* Essentially, the earth is wrinkling and the wrinkled parts are the mountains and the depressions between the trophs (wrinkles) are the oceans.

#### Problems with their theory

* Mountains show horizontal shortening/folding instead of vertical displacement.
  * Assuming we start out with horizontal/flat layers, we can assume they are folded and deformed until they are really messed up.
  * To get them to be messed up, what you need are compressional forces. This is going to squeeze the rocks and turn them into really deformed piece.
  * In actuality, there aren't compressional/horizontal forces.
  * If you put the mountains back into flat line rocks, you'd have to shorten them a lot.
  * You cannot account for the shortening of those rocks in this model.
* Gravity
  * It's a universal force between any two objects.

### Isostacy & Sir George Airy's Plum Bob (Wrong)

* **Isostacy** is the concept that the earth's crust is floating in gravitational equilibrium with the mantle.
  * If you want to have a big piece of the crust to go high, it turns out you need this crustal root. Because there's so much rock up above, it's pushing the crustal root down.
  * You cannot wrinkle earth and produce ocean basins.
* They used a plum bob in the survey. The gravitational pull of the earth are pulling it down, but some mountains to the right should pull the plumbob over a bit.
* Based on their original calculations, they thought the mountains would pull the plum bob a bit over by surveying how big the mountain was and what it was made of.
* They thought giant volcano was sitting on dense mantle, but the plum bob went nearly straight down.

### Geosyncilinal Theory & James Hall (Wrong)

#### Problems

* You can't produce kilometers of stuff with geosynclinal theory.
* We believe this happens on a small scale.

## Why Mountains Form on Coasts

### Wegener's Continental Drift

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2022-02-22 at 10.17.02@2x.jpg>)

* **Wegener** said there was a supercontinent called **Pangaea** that broke apart and drifted into these positions.

#### His Evidence

1. Puzzle pieces / good fit
   1. Found rocks & fossils that couldn't form or exist at today's latitudes.
2. Glacial deposits
   1. Further suggest rocks/fossils exist, but could not form at today's latitudes.
3. Other climate evidence
   1. Evaporite/salt deposits
   2. Coral reefs/swamps.
4. Fossil Distribution
5. Similar Geologic Structures

#### Forgotten

* Wergner died of a heart attack going to Greenland.
* His ideas died with him. At least, for a while.

#### Actual Forces?

### Seismic Waves

Seismic waves give us information on:

1. Plate boundary locations
2. Types of plate boundaries
3. The internal structure of the earth
4. How plates can move _(Brittle lithosphere floating on hot plastic asthenosphere)_
