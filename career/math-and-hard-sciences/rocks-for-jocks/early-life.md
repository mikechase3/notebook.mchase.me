# Early Life

## Characteristics

1. **Metabolism**: it turns food into energy and waste.
2. **Reproduction**
3. **Homeostasis:** living things can control an internal environment (body) relative to exterior events.

## Phylogenetic Tree of Life

### Basic Groups

1. Eucaryotes
2. Archaea
3. Bacteria

### Evolution & Ecology

* Life is very diverse: Millions and millions of species live from the highest mountaintops to the deepest parts of the ocean basin.
* Chemically, life is simple
  * **Made up of:** carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen.
  * **Chemical Reactions:** Sulphur, phosphate
  * These elements are the most abundant in the universe.

### Origin of Life

* **Monomers:** compounds that use the above elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen) and form things that life is made out of: $$CH_4, NH_3, CO_2, H_2O$$
* **Polymers:** even more complex: glucose sugar, carbonic carbohydrates.

## Early Life Experiments

### Central Questions for Debate

1. How did life originate on earth?
2. When and why did metazoans (multi-cellular animals) evolve?

### Qualities of Life

Recall all living things do 3 things: metabolize, achieve homeostasis, and reproduce.

#### Diverse Things

* Taxomically
* Morphologically
* Ecologicically

#### Simple Things

* Chemically CHON+SP => Monomers CH\_4, NH\_3, CO\_2, H\_2O => Polymers (Sugars, carbs, amino acids)

### Miller Urey Experiment

* Darwin's primordial soup and another experiment were not scientifically good?
* Miller designed an apparatus to model the ancient ocean.
* He tried to see if recreating these conditions could produce the same complex molecules.
* Significance
  * Demonstrated biomolecules can form under ancient earth-like conditions
  * Transformed some speculation into testable science.

### Sidney Fox

* **Similar Experiment:** he dried out the amino acids and saw thread-like strctures called protienoids. He also baked amino acid soup on "lava" bricks which formed globules called protobionts.

#### Hypothesis

First, chemical systems that fit the definition of "Alue" existed before packaging into a cell - (leaves no evidence "living molecules", "primodial geres"

The second part of the hypothesis is that living moleculs clump together into globules or protocells.

The third part is about earliest metabolisms. First is glycolosis or sugar fermentation. The second is chemosynthetic.

#### Stromatolites

* Occur today in extremely hot environment but they are rare.
* There's some really old stuff.

#### Cyanobacteria

Not sure what this is. Look it up.

### List of Things I don't know

1. Made of coaly organic matter
2. Display complex cellular structure - resemble modern prokaryotic cells.
3. Numerous specimens.
4. If part of a population they should exhibit variation.
5. Grow and reproduce like today's biological systems: preserved in various states of cell division.
6. Lived in a habitable environment.
7. If photosynthetic, should preserve that isotopic signature.

### Contamination Concerns

1. Ability to relocate and resample the same location with the same results.
2. Studied in thin section - fossils completely entombed in rock.
3. Fossils embedded in chert (microcrystalline quartz at the time of burial. Though, resistant container, and easily distinguished from post-burial (called diagenetic ?)

### Fossils of the Apex Chert

1. 1,900 cells were counted among over two hundred individuals.
2. 11 different species.
3. 6 were cyanobacteria - complex, photosynthetic, give off oxygen
4. 3 are more primitive bacteria, photosynthetic, aoxmysomething. He goes so fast!

### World of the Apex Chert

* Not much oxygen in the atmosphere.
* Lot of meteorite bombarding.
* Lots of UV radiation.

### Stromatolites

* Argument for it: they are more complex than they seem. There may be eight different zones in a stromatolite, each with its own microenvironments and each only a few millimeters thivk. The zones vary from super-rich in oxygen to zones without oxygen or light, saturated with H2S (hydrogen sulfide).
