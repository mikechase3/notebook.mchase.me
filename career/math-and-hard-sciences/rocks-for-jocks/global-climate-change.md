# Global Climate Change

## Lab Notes

* Glacial Rebound: after coastal glacier melts - land rises back up again; sea levels fall relative to the coastline.
* Sediment compaction: coastline sediments compact and sink over time, so sea levels rise more quickly relatively to the coastline.

## Study Guide Topics

**4) Global Climate Change**

Ø  Paleo-temperatures - oxygen isotope record of microfossils

Ø  Other types of paleoclimate data

Ø  Temperature records - nested cycles:

i) Long term - millions of years, cooling trend since 55 mya.

ii) Medium term - glacials (80 - 100 ka) & interglacials (5 - 20 ka).                                                    Currently in an interglacial.

iii) Short term - minor (100+ year) fluctuations, change from Little Ice Age to present.

&#x20;

Ø Mechanisms

i) Long term – Plate tectonic rates, continental configurations, weathering rates.

ii) Medium term – Milankovitch Cycles.

&#x20;                    Eccentricity -100,000 yrs.

&#x20;                    Obliquity (Tilt) - 41,000 yrs.

&#x20;                    Precession - 26,000 yrs.

iii) Short term – Sunspot Cycles, volcanic eruptions

Ø  Greenhouse Gases

Ø  Addition from anthropogenic sources - fossil fuel burning.

Ø  Correlation between temperature and gas abundance

Ø  What’s fact, what’s probable, what’s uncertain.
