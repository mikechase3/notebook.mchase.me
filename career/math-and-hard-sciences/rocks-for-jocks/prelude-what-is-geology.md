# Subfields of Geology

## In Search of Ideas

* Geologists explore the earth to determine how our planet works.

## Why Study Geology

* **Geology**: the study of the earth.

### Subfields of Geology

* Geology is very practical.
* Informs you about volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, deforestation, fault zones.

## Themes

* Geology is a synthesis of many sciences
  * Physics & Chemistry also describe the physical world.

> * The Earth has an internal structure
> * The outer layer of the Earth consists of moving plates
>   * The lithosphere is a 100-150km thick crust.
>   * The asthenosphere is a softer part of the mantle.
> * We can picture the Earth as a complex system: The Earth is not static, but rather can be pictured as a dynamic entity whose components move and change.
> * **The Earth is a planet**
>   * Like other planets; however, ours is very lively at the moment and oxygen rich.
> * Internal and external processes drive geologic phenomena:
>   * **Internal processes** are those driven by heat from inside the Earth. Plate movement is an example. Because plate movements cause mountain building, earthquakes, and volcanoes, we consider all of these phenomena internal processes (Fig. P.6b).
>   * **External processes** are those driven by energy coming to the Earth from the Sun. The heat produced by this energy drives the movement of air and water, which grinds and sculpts the Earthâ€™s surface and transports the debris to new locations, where it accumulates

* The Earth is Old
  * How the earth works changes quite often.
* The geologic time scale divides the Earth's history into intervals.
  * Phanerozoic Eon
  * Precambrian
  * Hadean
  * Proterozoic Eons
* Geologic phenomena affects society.
* Physical aspects of the earth interact with life processes
  * Photosynthesis is a good example.
  * Without life, it might be a frozen wasteland.
* The earth has changed dramatically in many ways over geologic time and continues to change.
  * Over earth's history, the planet, its composition, and sea level changes.
  * It's changing faster because of human activity.
* Most of the resources we use come from geologic materials
* Science comes from observation and people make scientific discoveries.
