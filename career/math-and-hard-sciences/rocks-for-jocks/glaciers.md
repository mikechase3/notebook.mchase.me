## Formation

* Glaciers form when snow that accumulates during a winter does not completely melt during the summer.
* 76% of the world's fresh water is frozen in glaciers.

## Types of Glaciers

1. **Valley or **_**Alpine Glaciers**_**: small glaciers that occupy valleys of high mountains.**
2. _**Continental Glaciers**_**: ice sheets that cover continental areas.** Two exist today. One on Greenland and one on Antartica.

## Erosion

* **Plucking:** i dunno.
* **Abrasion:** i dunno.
* Glaciers are incredible agents of erosion.

## Transportation

* What types of particles exist? (Clay to boulders)

## Landforms from Glacial Erosion

* Why are valleys U-shaped?
  * From erosion
  * Hanging valleys
  * Aretes & horns
  * Cirques & tarns
  * Fjords:&#x20;
*

## Glacial Deposits

* What is a till?: a form of unsorted sediment.
* What is outwash?: it is stratified and sorted. Includes kames and eskers.
* What is a kames/mound:&#x20;
* What is an esker: long sinuous ridges:&#x20;
* What does sinuous mean:&#x20;

## Glaciers as Indicators of Ancient Climate

Evidence:

* Glaciers exist in places that are too warm to have glaciers today. _Indicates a colder climate in the past_.
* Ice Cores are small bubbles of the earth's atmosphere trapped in the ice as it forms. We can calculate temperatures from the ancient atmospheric composition.

## Causes of Glacial Cycles

* What is a Malankovitch astronomic cycle:&#x20;
* What is eccentricity? How often does it happen?
* What is obliquity? How often does the earth tilt?
* What is precession? How often does the earth wobble?
