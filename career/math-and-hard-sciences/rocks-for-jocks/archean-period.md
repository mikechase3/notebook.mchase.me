# Archean Period

## Time period

* Hadean: 4.6by to 4.0by
* Archean: 4.0by to 2.5bya

### Granulites

* Highly metamorphosed gneisses (metamorphosed tonalities).
* These turn into greenstone?

### Greenstone Belts

* A form of metamorphism causes the rocks to be green.
* Ocean Basin Remnants
* Komatiite Silvers (1700 C)
  * It crystalizes at 1700 degrees celsius. It does not form in today's planet.
  * Lots of Fe (Iron) & Mg (Magnesium), so it's very dense.
  * As the rock melts, the minerals that melt at the lowest temperature are the more quartz rich.
  * As the komatiite plate melts,
* Pillow Bassalt
  * We interpert it as being ancient ocean basin.
  * Highly deformed, highly metamorphic.

Ask: why doesn't form. Convection currents are still occurring.

### No Mature Sediments

* Small continents; no continental shelves.
* Mature: round, mostly quartz.
* Immature: not well sorted. Less homogenus set of sediments.

### Banded Iron Formation

* They are very oxidized iron layers and black chert
  * Chert: very fine quartz with oxidized iron. Forms with no oxygen.
  * Iron oxide: requires oxygen to oxidize.
  * Problem: how do these two form?
* Answer: hydrothermal vent systems. Somewhere close-by, there are cyanobacteria that produces oxygen. The oxygen meets the dissolved iron.
  * We don't think the iron comes from continents.
  * There isn't enough atmosphere to oxidize iron on the continents; otherwise, we'd see more oxidized iron.
* Interpretation: it was a low-oxygen atmosphere.
* The last end about 2.5 billion years ago.

## Proterozoic

* 2.5 bya to 541 mya.
* Disappearance of banded iron formations.
* Appearance of Red Belts
* Increase in atmosphere O2.

### The Great Unconformity

## Hadean Eon Period

* 4.6-4.0 billion years ago.
* Differentiation and cooling of earth.
* Formation of the moon.
* Development of early atmosphere and hydrosphere
* End of intense meteor bombardment.

### Archean Period Recap

* 4-2.5 billion years ago.
* Small, steep sided continents, rapid tectonics, low O2 atmosphere.
* Only records of life are prokaryotes.
  * Part of the bacteria/archea.
  * Very simple.

### Proterozoic

* 2.5bn to \~500mya.
* Larger plate tectonics.
* More O2 in the atmosphere.
* Appearance of extensive red beds about 2.5mya.
* Evolution of the eukaryotic cells. We know that the mechanism for which they survive is dependent on more oxygen.
