# Introductory FAQs?

## What is Statistics?

* A way of reasoning, along with a set of tools and methods, to help us answer questions about the world.
* Statistics is most often concerned with data
  * How can we collect data that will help us answer our question?
  * How should we draw conclusions from data we have?

## How is it different than Probability?

**Probability** tells us results when we know truth about the world, called the probability model, and study the implications. **Statistics** is the opposite, where you ask "You roll a die 100 times and got a six 20 times. Is this die fair? Well, it depends:

* What are your beliefs?&#x20;
* How much is at stake?&#x20;

The standard of evidence depends on your prior experiences, beliefs, and how important the issue at hand is.
