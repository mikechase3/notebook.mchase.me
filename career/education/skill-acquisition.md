# Skill Acquisition

## Mapping of Skill Acquisition onto Models of Decision Making

* On the right, notice that as we go higher up, we require conscious attention. As we move lower down the letter, the behaviors become more automatic & don't require attention.

* Progression down the chart depends on how **automatable** that the task is.&#x20;
* Tasks with more variability like social skills might be inaccessible for stage 2 and 3 trainees.

## Importance of Task Consistency

* Tasks are easier to automate when they are consistent ([Fitts & Posner 1967](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233446680_The_role_of_working_memory_in_sport))
* Some tasks are impossible to automate, particularly those that are inconsistent.

## Learning Curve

The rate of improving skills & knowledge is high initially, but eventually decreases over time as training continue.

* Too little training leads to issues in retaining skills in the long-term.
* Too much training raises skills & knowledge only slightly and provides diminishing marginal returns.
* Different types of models are used to predict skill acquisition prediction like exponential fits, power fits, hyperbolic fits, and logarithmic fits.&#x20;
  * For group data, power curves tend to be the best fit.&#x20;
