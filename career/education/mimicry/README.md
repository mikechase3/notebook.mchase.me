# Mimicry

[Episode 99 of _No Stupid Questions_](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/do-you-mind-if-i-borrow-your-personality/) reviews research and concludes that mimicry is the best way to learn; much better than reading written texts.

In my experience:

* Watching Youtube videos of math problems (from Khan Academy) is better than following instructions.
* Mimicking APA/MLA styles from existing sources is always faster than reading the manual.
* Asking for help directly from a professor is faster than learning it myself.
