| Knowledge     | <p>Knowledge involves recognizing or remembering facts, terms, basic concepts, or answers without necessarily understanding what they mean. Some characteristics may include:</p><ul><li>Knowledge of specifics—terminology, specific facts</li><li>Knowledge of ways and means of dealing with specifics—conventions, trends and sequences, classifications and categories</li><li>Knowledge of the universals and abstractions in a field—principles and generalizations, theories and structures</li></ul> | Name three common varieties of apple.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Comprehension | Comprehension involves demonstrating an understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, summarizing, translating, generalizing, giving descriptions, and stating the main ideas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Summarize the identifying characteristics of a Golden Delicious apple and a Granny Smith apple.                                                                                                       |
| Application   | Application involves using acquired knowledge to solve problems in new situations. This involves applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules. Learners should be able to use prior knowledge to solve problems, identify connections and relationships and how they apply in new situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Would apples prevent scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin C?                                                                                                                           |
| Analysis      | <p>Analysis involves examining and breaking information into component parts, determining how the parts relate to one another, identifying motives or causes, making inferences, and finding evidence to support generalizations. Its characteristics include:</p><ul><li>Analysis of elements</li><li>Analysis of relationships</li><li>Analysis of organization</li></ul>                                                                                                                                   | Compare and contrast four ways of serving foods made with apples and examine which ones have the highest health benefits.                                                                             |
| Synthesis     | <p>Synthesis involves building a structure or pattern from diverse elements; it also refers to the act of putting parts together to form a whole or bringing pieces of information together to form a new meaning. Its characteristics include:</p><ul><li>Production of a unique communication</li><li>Production of a plan, or proposed set of operations</li><li>Derivation of a set of abstract relations</li></ul>                                                                                       | Convert an "unhealthy" recipe for apple pie to a "healthy" recipe by replacing your choice of ingredients. Argue for the health benefits of using the ingredients you chose versus the original ones. |
| Evaluation    | <p>Evaluation involves presenting and defending opinions by making judgments about information, the validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of criteria. Its characteristics include:</p><ul><li>Judgments in terms of internal evidence</li><li>Judgments in terms of external criteria</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                               | Which kinds of apples are suitable for baking a pie, and why?                                                                                                                                         |

### Maslow

This basically says the kids learn the best during self-actualization. They won't learn nearly as well  if they don't feel safe & have friends or feel belittled by giant vocabulary.

## Tips

### Activate Prior Schema

Schema is the organization of previous knowledge.&#x20;

* "Activate prior schema" means to give context to the lesson. Bring up related topics so they can organize their knowledge logically.&#x20;
* Example: if you taught a programming class, you'd discuss the mathematical meaning of a variable, the rules governing a variable, its uses, etc.

There is a word that's the same word in both languages, but have different meanings called a **cognite**. A crayon is what you use to color & in French, it's something different. A _variable_ is a false cognite. Once you've activated their schema in math, you **should discuss that it's different from math** because the kids will try to apply mathematical rules to it. For example, in programming you might write the expression `x = x+2`, but that's not mathematically solvable with their mathematical knowledge.&#x20;

### Zone of Proximal Development

Vygotsky's theory of learning and development lists three zones:

1. Something a learner can do independently with no assistance
2. Something a learner can do with support
3. Something a learner cannot do, even with significant support Lessons should always be in their Zone of Proximal Development. Not everyone in the class will have the same ZPD.



### Scaffolding

Beginning a topic with significant support and slowly removing support as the student becomes more independent.

1. Block Coding
2. Partially created code with syntax charts
3. Partially written code
4. Explicit instructions for what the final program should do and look like
5. General requirements

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not everyone at your class will be at the same level. Some kids will need block coding while others can skip right to text-based coding. Keep this in mind when designing activities and add in supports for those who are not there yet.
{% endhint %}

### Use their names

* Make name-tags
* Builds good things like trust, engagement, validates them.

### Use the Space

1. Don't stand in front of the class & lecture. Move around & be with them and use the space.

### Student Centered Learning

Use **student centered learning**: throughout the lesson, you should constantly be asking "what are the students doing?" The answer should not be "listening to the teacher" for more than a few minutes per hour. Students should be actively engaged in the lesson. During a lecture-style instruction, it is appropriate to give the students guided notes to fill out and follow along. Guided notes are where if they lose their place, they can pick it up just by reading the context.

There's information that says just the act of writing things down increases retainment more.

### Instructional Types

**Instructional types**: there is **direct instruction** where an instructor talks while they listen. **Modeling** is better - where the instructor demonstrattes the correct way to complete a task so they can see the process. **Guided instruction** is the third type of instruction where the bulk is. You should do the task, but ask the class a lot of questions for the students & get the kids to tell you what to do. This lets them listen to their peers and it'll foster a better classroom. This is where a lot of learning happens. Lastly, there's independent instruction where they are working by themselves. They should only need minimal support from the instructor. **Discovery Learning:** you don't give any information to the student, but ask questions to lead them in the correct direction.&#x20;

Below: - students learn via discovery to slide their finger up & down to learn operations with +/-. It increases self efficacy that they're capable of learning too!

### **Load vocabulary when appropriate**:&#x20;

* Vocabulary can be front-loaded: give them the term, definition, and explanation.
* Vocabulary can also be back-loaded: the instructor or student gives the definition and discuss first BEFORE the term is even given.
* ALWAYS AVOID CENTER LOADING VOCABULARY: introducing a new term half-way through a lesson.
* Do not give anyone more than 5 terms per lesson. It's inappropriate to firehose them with vocabulary.
  * "Instantiate a new turtle object" is bad.&#x20;
  * Write down the turtle lesson somewhere.&#x20;
