# Microsoft MakeCode

See Microsft Makecode's [Home Page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode). Better yet, just go to `arcade.makecode.com` to view sample projects and get started [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/).

## MakeCode's Block Coding Interface

The interface is a lot like scratch:

It contains lots of sample assets:

## Text Editor:

You can also convert it to a python/js. Interestingly, the images are built from raw text strings.
