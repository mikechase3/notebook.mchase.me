## Motivation of Reflections

* Reflection is an organizing process.
* Organization of where we stand to make better decisions of where we place ourselves in our social hierarchy. (I'm worse at dancing, but smarter than dancers in computing, in general).
  * Largely varies person-to-person; e.g. _some value music & arts and others don't._
  * Could be backed by stereotype; e.g. _the CompSci is 'smarter' and will be rich._
* Also cites reactions, feelings, and analyzes experience in a personal way.
* **Audience-Dependent**: for a comedy story or critical reflection? Should your tone be collective and practical, or strong and assertive?

## Questions to Ask

Use these to verify that this is a good reflection:

* Does the paper present what you observed (objective discussion)
* Does it show what you experienced or made me feel and explain why (subjective discussion)?
* What worked well and what did not. What was fair or unfair? What was effective or ineffective and why?
