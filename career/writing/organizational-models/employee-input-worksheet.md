# Employee Input Worksheet



## Employee Input Worksheet

\
Use this worksheet to help you write your employee input. Two approaches are provided to help you with completing this activity, you might find that one approach is easier or more meaningful, depending upon the type of work that you do. These two approaches are:

•         ORCA – Objective, Results, Contribution, Added Value

•         SCRAM – Situation, Challenge, Results, Actions, Measurements

Start the activity by answering each question in the My Notes column. Then combine these notes into employee input in the space underneath the table. Use a fresh worksheet for each performance element employee input. Rating officials can also use this worksheet to help write performance element appraisals. As you write, refer to the _Employee Input Do’s and Don’ts Tip Sheet_ for additional advice. Keep in mind that the MyPerformance Tool has a 2,000 character limit for each performance element employee input. The examples in the table below are based on the following sample performance element:

Sample Performance Element

Analyze data to develop at least 20 technically sound, analytical reports on time and within budget by proactively planning, organizing and prioritizing work schedule, adjusting to meet competing needs. Twelve of these reports are the monthly reports, due by the seventh business day of the following month. The remainder of the reports and the due dates will be assigned by a supervisor. These reports support recommendations to mission-critical changes that save money and time for the organization.

The ORCA Approach

Sample Employee Input

I performed at the “Fully Successful” level for this performance standard. I effectively analyzed budget data and produced 20 analytical reports on time and within budget. I proactively adjusted my work schedule to meet competing needs and have all work products turned in on time. My supervisor used recommendations I made in three different reports as support for recommendations to mission-critical changes resulting in a 10 percent cost savings. I worked with our IT specialist to develop a new report in our accounting system and provided the needed algorithms for programming. This report has reduced production time for monthly reports by three days in our department. I developed my technical proficiency by taking a course on new research techniques.

**Sample Employee Input**

I performed at the “Fully Successful” level for performance standard. My role is to provide analytical reports that are foundational support for mission-critical recommendations and budget tracking. To this end, I effectively analyzed budget data and produced 20 analytical reports on time and within budget. My supervisor used recommendations I made in three different reports as support for recommendations to mission-critical changes resulting in a 10 percent cost savings. One of the challenges I faced was in November the mission-focus of my unit shifted and I needed to adapt and shift my focus to a new area of analysis and a different way of reporting. As I did this, I discovered that some of the information we needed was not readily available from our accounting software's existing reports. I worked with our IT specialist to develop a new report and I provided the needed algorithms for programming. This report has reduced production time for monthly reports by three days in our department. I proactively adjusted my work schedule to meet competing needs and have all work products turned in on- time. Also, to help me adjust to the new focus, I developed my technical proficiency by taking a course on new research techniques.
