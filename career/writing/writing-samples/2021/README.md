## Uncertainty

* Democracies are fragile. Riot?

## "Unity"

## Saving the Planet

* Gimlet Media's podcast inspirational to dedicate your life like that.

## Tech Companies

* Facebook is a bit too powerful and is getting itself into trouble.

## Works Cited

* I always start with Time Magazine's much better [article](https://time.com/6129888/2021-year-in-review/). They are the primary source for what I listed in the highlights.
