# Virtue Ethics

* Virtue Ethics is necessary for excellence and a good life.

## Plato

* Critiqued virtue ethics of the time.
* He did not like how different principles applied to different groups of people.
  * Men and women especially.
* Plato says there's _one_ good.

### Four Cardinal Virtues

* **Wisdom:** Allows us to interpret truths.
* **Courage:** Humans have a natural tendency to feel successful.
* **Self-Control \(Temperance\)**: Courage is a horse that wants to move forward regardless of hazards. Wisdom holds the reigns.

## Aristotle

* Aristotle has two types of goods:
* **Instrumental:** Good grades, money. It's not good in it of itself but helps us get what we want.
* **Intrinsic:** good for its own sake, not for something else. _ie. friendship._
* _**Eudaemonia**: Never instrumental, always intrinsic._

### Types of Virtue

* **Intellectual Virtues:** are a result of teaching.
* **Moral Virtues:** are a result of habit and how we choose to live our lives. \(Habit involves human choice, not being passive\).

### Defining Moral Virtue \(Book 2, Section 6\)

* Airstotle makes this argument very carefully.
* Aristotle categorizes groups. \(His favorite animal was the cuddlefish\).

### The Function Argument \(Book 1 Section 7\)

* The _good and well_ is though to reside in the function -&gt; man has function.
  * Man eats/breathes and all, but other animals do that.
  * Thinking and reasoning is what make men unique.
* There remains the active life of the element that has a rational principle.
* A virtue is good if it is performed by a good rational man in an excellent manner.
* Happiness is humans acting in accordance with virtue.

### Virtue Definition

* Virtue, then, is a state of character concerned with choice, lying in a mean, i.e. the mean relative to us, this being determined by a rational principle, and by that principle by which the man of practical wisdom would determine it.
* State of character concerned with voice -&gt; your state of mind you cultivated. \(How we choose to be\)
* Determined by a rational principle -&gt; living things have soles. Our function is thinking.
* Phronesis: practical wisdom. It's what someone an "expert in ethics" would determine.
* Lying in a mean relative to us... for next time.

### The Golden Mean

![Goldilocks is on a hunt for the &apos;perfect&apos; amount.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28243%29.png)

> Lying in a mean... relative to us.

* The mean between excess and deficiency of whatever ingredient would make it a moral virtue.
* **Relative to us**: the too hard/too soft is not calibrated to _The Hulk_. 
* An expert is able to take many factors into consideration. 

#### Cowardliness, Courage, and Recklessness

#### Insensibility, Temperance, Indulgence

![An advertisement for the prohibition.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28250%29.png)

* Insensibility is a deficiency.
* Temperance is the mean
* Indulgence is excess.

#### Generosity: Meanness, Liberality, Prodigality

* Meanness: Too little
* Liberality: Mean
* Excess: prodigality

#### Humor: Borishness, Wit, Buffoonery

* Boorishness: Deficiency
* Wit: Mean
* Buffoonery: excess

## Immanuel Kant

* Morality must be rooted in _reason_, not _emotion_. 

### Religion

* Religion is going to vary from person to person.
* Instead, morality is a constant, almost like mathematics.

### Hypothetical Imperatives

* Most of the time, whether or not we ought to do something isn't a moral choice, but rather, it's contingent upon our desires.
* These are about prudence, not morality.
* If you don't care about getting a good grade, then studying is optional.

### The Categorical Imperative

{% hint style="info" %}
Commands you must follow regardless of your desires. These are moral obligations derived from pure reason.
{% endhint %}

* Act as though the maxim of your action were to become, through your will, a universal law of nature \(24\).
* * A _maxim_ is any actionable statement. Like "everyone should not lie."
  * It needs to be **universal** 
  * No contradictions are allowed.
* You must be able to rationally establish that all other rational beings must always do this action as a matter of moral course.
* Everyone has to follow these because _everyone_ has the ability to be rational \(26\).
  * Except slaves maybe.
* Do not _use_ people, but respect everyone's dignity even though we're all sort-of using our employers as means for a paycheck and employers using us as a means for profit.
  * We're also treated with respect and freely-choosing individuals.

#### Summary

Proper, rational application of the categorical imperative will lead us to moral truth that is fixed & applicable to all moral agents.

### Hedonic Calculus

* **Sensation**: Intensity, Duration, Certainty/Uncertainty \(Obviousness of Sensation\), Propinquity.
* **Relationship:** Fecundity \(Fruitfulness/Racism\). Purity \(absence of side effects\).

### The Universalization Principle

> Act only according to that maxim which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction.

#### Why Stealing Doesn't Work

* If you steal a banana, you are universalizing an idea.
  * This is a contradiction.
  * Everyone cannot steal bananas.
* Everyone would be stealing bananas from each other
  * It's not practical.

### The Formula of Humanity

> "Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in your own person or in that of another, always as an end, and never as a mere means."

* Humans exist for themselves.
* Recognizing an "end-in-oneself" means to recognize the humanity of the person you're interacting with and keeping that in mind.
* It's ok to use people people, but not as a _mere_ means.
