# Scrum

#### Scrum:

* Sprint: fixed time box for development work, usually one month or two weeks.
* Daily Stand-Up: team members review previous day's work, plans for today, and address blockers.
* Release: completed code or features delivered frequently.
* Sprint Review: checking achievable features and feedback incorporation.
* Sprint Retrospective: reviewing product quality and process improvements.
* Product Backlog: prioritized list of tasks/features by Product Owner.
* Sprint Backlog: list of tasks planned for the next sprint.
* Scrum emphasizes fast delivery with fixed-length work windows.

#### Scrum Standups:

* Short meetings to track progress and address blockers.
* Focus on resolving communication, technical, and operational issues.
* As teams grow, standup meetings may become less effective in tracking everyone's work.

#### Kanban:

* Tasks completed outside fixed windows, added to TODO list and assigned with set priorities.
* Tasks move through a similar process as Scrum boards but do not have fixed sprint timelines.

#### Similarities:

* Tasks planned similarly with assignments, sub-tasks, and estimates.
* Scrum is for more frequent product delivery with detailed planning and review.
* Self-management and organization are essential aspects in both Scrum and Kanban.

#### Low-Level Team Roles:

* Scrum roles include Product Owner (prioritizes backlog), Scrum Master (ensures Agile practices are followed, helps remove blockers), and Developers (work on product development).
* Kanban has a looser framework without defined roles, but may include a service delivery manager alongside developers.

#### Development Team:

* Keep teams small enough to be fed with two pizzas for better efficiency.
* Emphasize self-reflection and self-organization within the development team.
* Consider breaking down larger projects into smaller subteams for effective management.

### Self-Organization:

* Self-organization does not eliminate the need for management but empowers teams to decide how to work within set boundaries.
* Managers should observe the team, identify areas for improvement, and guide organizational changes flexibly.
* Self-organizing teams operate at three levels: Containers (boundaries), Differences (skills and experiences), and Exchanges (idea transmission).

#### Agile Framework Considerations:

* Factors influencing team organization include Containers (team size, structure), Differences (skills, decision-making styles), and Exchanges (communication methods).
* Question the use of Agile frameworks that heavily rely on estimates and consider alternative approaches with less focus on sprints and more on task execution.

#### Agile Adoption Considerations:

* Agile adoption success depends on proper implementation and adherence to Agile principles.
* Agile works well in environments with no process, strong process, clear tasking, continuous reporting, and monitoring needs.
