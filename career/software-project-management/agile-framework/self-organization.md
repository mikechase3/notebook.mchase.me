# Self-Organization
## Containers
* **Containers**: come boundary within a team. You sit in your seats for a concert. Location, departments, offices, etc.
* **Differences**: skills, experiences, etc. The role you have on the team, responsibilities.
* **Exchanges** transmission of ideas: meeting with the product owner can help shape nxt steps
* Change the number of people on the team
* Change who is on the team
* Introduce a new container (sub-teams)
* Given the team more or less responsibility
* Change the team's physical space.

## Differences
* If your team isn't doing well you can introduce a new team member with new skills, experiences. 
* Ask hard questions of the team to ensure different viewpoints.
* you could 'change the team's decision making style' like agile framework but prof doesn't like this one.
* Encourage dissenting viewpoints (like go around the room).

## Exchanges
For example, professor noticed working in companies there are chains of companies. The less people you need to make a decision on something, the better. Not everything needs a bunch of people communicating together. Here's what you can do:

* Add or remove people from an exchange. Let the developer build the tool and not have their needs sign-off on their flowchart beforehand.
* Formalize/deformalize an exchange.
* Change how an exchange occurs. (Be face to face, email, etc).
* Change the frequency of exchanges or meetings.
