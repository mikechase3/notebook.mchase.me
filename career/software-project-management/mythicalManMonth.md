# Brook's Law / Mythical Man Month
* Basically, if you add develoeprs into something complex, it's not going to go any faster.
* "The Mythical Man-Month" is a classic book written by Frederick Brooks in 1975, in which Brooks introduced the concept of Brooks' Law. The main premise of Brooks' Law states that adding more manpower to a late software project only makes it later. In other words, throwing more people at a project running behind schedule will only further delay the completion due to the time needed for new team members to get up to speed, communication overhead, and coordination difficulties.
* Brooks famously illustrated the law with the analogy that nine women can't make a baby in one month. This concept highlights the complexity and interdependencies in software projects, suggesting that adding more people can sometimes impede progress rather than accelerate it. Brooks' Law serves as a cautionary reminder for project managers and teams to carefully consider the implications of scaling up the workforce on a late project.
