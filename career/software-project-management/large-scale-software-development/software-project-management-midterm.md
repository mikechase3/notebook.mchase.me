# Software Project Management Midterm

## Understanding the Assignment

There's a list of plans. Pick one topic area and do a project plan. Then do the following:

* [ ] &#x20;Write a 1-2 page review of the subject matter. Include major competitors, technical background of the area, history of the topic, and current best practices.&#x20;
* [ ] Create a table that lists proposed technical tasks for the project. Give a two-sentence explanation of the task with at least eight technical tasks.
* [ ] Graphically created a task list containing major and subtasks within a Gantt chart.&#x20;
  * [ ] Include selected _completion_ or due dates .&#x20;
* [ ] Create a table displaying staff & their total hour breakdown/cost.
  * [ ] Total hour breakdown
  * [ ] Cost across the whole project.&#x20;
* [ ] Create a monthly line graph to visualize and predict how expenses are distributed over time, with each month representing the x-axis (independent variable) and the total cost as the y-axis (dependent variable).
  * [ ] Plot a budget as y=$budget
  * [ ] Add axes, a title, axes titles, legend.

### Requirements

* [ ] Proposal budget must be between $400K-$500K.&#x20;
* [ ] Scope is 2024JAN01-2024DEC31
* [ ] Mock budget over the level of effort required to complete each deliverable.&#x20;
* [ ] Use the mock budget attached.
* [ ] 12 point times new roman font with 1" margins with excel spreadsheets and charts attached in the document and as separate attachments.&#x20;

### Review -  Digital Twin Simulation Stealth Spray Painting

Specifically: create a digital twin VR/AR tool which offers a way for manufacturing plants to safely train their employees.

Here's some scenarios I could choose from:

1. Digital twin of spray-painting process of stealth parts and material properties of the paints. Components are 1) real-time data acquisition ofputting sensors on paint cans and analyzing which layers, angles, and power settings get used during the process. The physics and material properties of the paint & the ergonomics of how employees should position themselves and move while painting are important. **Components:** a real time data acquisition uses sensors on spray-painting equipment to gather data on factors like pressure, speed, and paint flow. The VR training module will let trainees interact with the digital twin with scenairos that mimic real-life conditions, allowing those users to practice without the risk of waste or injury. Then there's a feedback system that AI can use to provide instant feedback based on the trainee's actions, allowing for cusomized training experiences.&#x20;
