## Product Documentation - what should product be like?

### Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

* Products are sets of features helping users achieve their goals. They're called **functional requirements.**
  * For example: User checks the order status.
* Non-functional requirements are also required.&#x20;
  * For example: Must support 10K users at the same time



### User Experience UX Documentation

#### User Personas

* Often represented in comic book form.
* Tells devs about **what users want**, need, and behave.&#x20;
