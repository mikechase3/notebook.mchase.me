* Collaboration between business people and developers daily
* Build projects around motivated individuals with necessary support and trust
* Face-to-face conversation for effective information sharing
* Working software as the primary measure of progress
* Sustainable development with a constant pace
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
* Maximizing work not done through simplicity
* Self-organizing teams for best architectures, requirements, and designs
* Regular reflection and adjustment for team effectiveness
* About 1/6th is you typing code.
* About 1/3rd of your time is planning it.
* 1/2 of it is interacting/testing/playing with your code.
