## Summary of Principles

* Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
* Welcome changing requirements for the customer's advantage
* Deliver working software frequently, with a preference for shorter timescales
* Collaboration between business people and developers daily
* Build projects around motivated individuals with necessary support and trust
* Face-to-face conversation for effective information sharing
* Working software as the primary measure of progress
* Sustainable development with a constant pace
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
* Maximizing work not done through simplicity
* Self-organizing teams for best architectures, requirements, and designs
* Regular reflection and adjustment for team effectiveness
* About 1/6th is you typing code.
* About 1/3rd of your time is planning it.
* 1/2 of it is interacting/testing/playing with your code.

## Key Components of Agile

* Task creation and monitoring using Scrum or Kanban
* Continuous Integration: integrating code changes frequently into a shared repository
* Test-Driven development: verifying and validating code to meet requirements and reduce defects
* Shared but defined development methods like pair programming to improve code quality and reduce defects

## Agile SDLC:

* Requirement phase
* Architecture and design phase
* Development phase
* Test and feedback phase

## Advantages of Agile:

* Quicker deployment of software leading to increased customer trust
* Adaptability to changing requirements for quicker response
* Emphasis on people and interactions over processes and tools
* Increased collaboration, communication, and team morale
* Flexibility, adaptability, improved quality, enhanced customer satisfaction

## Disadvantages of Agile:

* Difficulty assessing effort in large projects at initial stages
* Focus on code over documentation
* Dependency on customer inputs leading to project deviations
* Challenges in face-to-face communication in large organizations
* Need for senior programmers for decision-making leading to difficulties for new programmers
* Lack of predictability, testing emphasis, risk of team burnout, lack of structure and governance

## Quick Definitions

* Popular Agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, Hybrid, Lean, Bimodal, XP, Crystal (focusing on Scrum and Kanban).
* Scrum: fixed-length development iterations, suited for well-defined tasks with clear deliverables.
* Kanban: continuous releases, suited for open-ended tasks.

### Scrum:

* Sprint: fixed time box for development work, usually one month or two weeks.
* Daily Stand-Up: team members review previous day's work, plans for today, and address blockers.
* Release: completed code or features delivered frequently.
* Sprint Review: checking achievable features and feedback incorporation.
* Sprint Retrospective: reviewing product quality and process improvements.
* Product Backlog: prioritized list of tasks/features by Product Owner.
* Sprint Backlog: list of tasks planned for the next sprint.
* Scrum emphasizes fast delivery with fixed-length work windows.

### Scrum Standups:

* Short meetings to track progress and address blockers.
* Focus on resolving communication, technical, and operational issues.
* As teams grow, standup meetings may become less effective in tracking everyone's work.

### Kanban:

* Tasks completed outside fixed windows, added to TODO list and assigned with set priorities.
* Tasks move through a similar process as Scrum boards but do not have fixed sprint timelines.

### Similarities:

* Tasks planned similarly with assignments, sub-tasks, and estimates.
* Scrum is for more frequent product delivery with detailed planning and review.
* Self-management and organization are essential aspects in both Scrum and Kanban.

### Low-Level Team Roles:

* Scrum roles include Product Owner (prioritizes backlog), Scrum Master (ensures Agile practices are followed, helps remove blockers), and Developers (work on product development).
* Kanban has a looser framework without defined roles, but may include a service delivery manager alongside developers.

### Development Team:

* Keep teams small enough to be fed with two pizzas for better efficiency.
* Emphasize self-reflection and self-organization within the development team.
* Consider breaking down larger projects into smaller subteams for effective management.

## Self-Organization:

* Self-organization does not eliminate the need for management but empowers teams to decide how to work within set boundaries.
* Managers should observe the team, identify areas for improvement, and guide organizational changes flexibly.
* Self-organizing teams operate at three levels: Containers (boundaries), Differences (skills and experiences), and Exchanges (idea transmission).

### Agile Framework Considerations:

* Factors influencing team organization include Containers (team size, structure), Differences (skills, decision-making styles), and Exchanges (communication methods).
* Question the use of Agile frameworks that heavily rely on estimates and consider alternative approaches with less focus on sprints and more on task execution.

### Agile Adoption Considerations:

* Agile adoption success depends on proper implementation and adherence to Agile principles.
* Agile works well in environments with no process, strong process, clear tasking, continuous reporting, and monitoring needs.

## Software Development Life Cycle

### Introduction

**Project**: A planned undertaking that has a beginning and end and produces some definitive result. Most projects fall on a continuum between predictive and adaptive:

### Predictive Approach

* Waterfall Model
* Assumes the project can be planned in advance and that the information system can be developed according to the plan.
* Requirements are well understood and/or low technical risk.

### Adaptive Approach to the SDLC

* Iterative model (we will use this approach in capstone courses)
* Assumes the project must be more flexible and adapt to changing needs.

## Agile and Iterative Development Approaches

### System Development Process

* This describes the actual approach used to develop a particular information system. _Aka a methodology_.

### Agile Development

An information system development process that emphasizes flexibility to anticipate new requirements during development.

### Iterative Development

![A visualization of iterative development.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (170).png>)

An approach to system development in which the system is "grown" piece by piece through multiple iterations:

### Unified Process (UP)

* An architecture-centric, use-case drive, iterative and incremental development process using UML

### Extreme Programming

* Aims to produce higher quality software.
* More responsive to changing customer requirements

### SCRUM

* A simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products..

## SCRUM

{% hint style="info" %}
The approach we're using in our capstone.
{% endhint %}

* Scrum is a development approach.
* Combination of principles of Rugby and Agile.
* Intense effort involving the entire team for a defined period of time.

### Product Backlog

* Prioritized list of user requirements.
* You can see a list of user requirements.
* The more requirements you have, the more detailed your project is.

### Product Owner

* The client stakeholder
* Controls the backlog

### SCRUM Master

* Project manager.
* Uses management tools to maximize efficiency.

### SCRUM Sprints

A sprint is a time-controlled mini-project that implements part of a larger program.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (171).png>)

### SCRUM Practices

* The scope of each sprint is small and unchanging. Sometimes the workload is reduced.
* Daily SCRUM meetings
  * What have you done since the last daily SCRUM meeting?
  * What will you do by the next daily SCRUM?
  * What kept you or is keeping you from completing your work?

## Messenger Requirement Project

### Sprint

* Sprint 0: Requirements, analysis, and system design
* Sprint 1: Messenger 0.1: Architecture and UI Design/Prototyping
* Sprint 2: Messenger 0.2: Quality Analysis: Simple authentication
* Sprint 3: Messenger 0.3: Storing user data: database design and development.

* Lab 1: A simple chat system app deployment on the cloud
* Lab 2: User registration and authentication
* Lab 3: Handle database for messenger. (Google Firebase?)
