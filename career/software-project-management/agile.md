## Summary of Principles

* Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
* Welcome changing requirements for the customer's advantage
* Deliver working software frequently, with a preference for shorter timescales
* Collaboration between business people and developers daily
* Build projects around motivated individuals with necessary support and trust
* Face-to-face conversation for effective information sharing
* Working software as the primary measure of progress
* Sustainable development with a constant pace
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
* Maximizing work not done through simplicity
* Self-organizing teams for best architectures, requirements, and designs
* Regular reflection and adjustment for team effectiveness
* About 1/6th is you typing code.
* About 1/3rd of your time is planning it.
* 1/2 of it is interacting/testing/playing with your code.

## Key Components of Agile

* Task creation and monitoring using Scrum or Kanban
* Continuous Integration: integrating code changes frequently into a shared repository
* Test-Driven development: verifying and validating code to meet requirements and reduce defects
* Shared but defined development methods like pair programming to improve code quality and reduce defects

## Agile SDLC:

* Requirement phase
* Architecture and design phase
* Development phase
* Test and feedback phase

## Advantages of Agile:

* Quicker deployment of software leading to increased customer trust
* Adaptability to changing requirements for quicker response
* Emphasis on people and interactions over processes and tools
* Increased collaboration, communication, and team morale
* Flexibility, adaptability, improved quality, enhanced customer satisfaction

## Disadvantages of Agile:

* Difficulty assessing effort in large projects at initial stages
* Focus on code over documentation
* Dependency on customer inputs leading to project deviations
* Challenges in face-to-face communication in large organizations
* Need for senior programmers for decision-making leading to difficulties for new programmers
* Lack of predictability, testing emphasis, risk of team burnout, lack of structure and governance

## Quick Definitions

* Popular Agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, Hybrid, Lean, Bimodal, XP, Crystal (focusing on Scrum and Kanban).
* Scrum: fixed-length development iterations, suited for well-defined tasks with clear deliverables.
* Kanban: continuous releases, suited for open-ended tasks.

### Scrum:

* Sprint: fixed time box for development work, usually one month or two weeks.
* Daily Stand-Up: team members review previous day's work, plans for today, and address blockers.
* Release: completed code or features delivered frequently.
* Sprint Review: checking achievable features and feedback incorporation.
* Sprint Retrospective: reviewing product quality and process improvements.
* Product Backlog: prioritized list of tasks/features by Product Owner.
* Sprint Backlog: list of tasks planned for the next sprint.
* Scrum emphasizes fast delivery with fixed-length work windows.

### Scrum Standups:

* Short meetings to track progress and address blockers.
* Focus on resolving communication, technical, and operational issues.
* As teams grow, standup meetings may become less effective in tracking everyone's work.

### Kanban:

* Tasks completed outside fixed windows, added to TODO list and assigned with set priorities.
* Tasks move through a similar process as Scrum boards but do not have fixed sprint timelines.

### Similarities:

* Tasks planned similarly with assignments, sub-tasks, and estimates.
* Scrum is for more frequent product delivery with detailed planning and review.
* Self-management and organization are essential aspects in both Scrum and Kanban.

### Low-Level Team Roles:

* Scrum roles include Product Owner (prioritizes backlog), Scrum Master (ensures Agile practices are followed, helps remove blockers), and Developers (work on product development).
* Kanban has a looser framework without defined roles, but may include a service delivery manager alongside developers.

### Development Team:

* Keep teams small enough to be fed with two pizzas for better efficiency.
* Emphasize self-reflection and self-organization within the development team.
* Consider breaking down larger projects into smaller subteams for effective management.

## Self-Organization:

* Self-organization does not eliminate the need for management but empowers teams to decide how to work within set boundaries.
* Managers should observe the team, identify areas for improvement, and guide organizational changes flexibly.
* Self-organizing teams operate at three levels: Containers (boundaries), Differences (skills and experiences), and Exchanges (idea transmission).

### Agile Framework Considerations:

* Factors influencing team organization include Containers (team size, structure), Differences (skills, decision-making styles), and Exchanges (communication methods).
* Question the use of Agile frameworks that heavily rely on estimates and consider alternative approaches with less focus on sprints and more on task execution.

### Agile Adoption Considerations:

* Agile adoption success depends on proper implementation and adherence to Agile principles.
* Agile works well in environments with no process, strong process, clear tasking, continuous reporting, and monitoring needs.
