## History

### Mediums

It's important to keep track of the different mediums I tried:

| Method or Medium                | Advantages                                                                                                                        | Disadvantages                                                                                                     |

## Strategies

#### EASE: Early College

If you're in high school or early on in your college career, keep your resume to 1-page and use the **EASE** method. Later, you should organize it in the opposite way. This is an acronym:

* **E**ducation
* **A**ctivities
* **S**kills
* **E**xperience

#### \`pickett.pdf\` method

I'm at the point where I have enough work experience and talking points where I can exceed a page and talk about things other than my educational experience. I was involved with the interviewing process of some faculty. My favorite organization method comes from a document called `pickett.pdf`.&#x20;

| Heading                        | What to write                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
