# Informational Interviews
* Ten minutes is really easy for someone to spare. 
* Make it really simple. 
* Could I have 5-10m of your time for a critique and position myself with my ability?



* What happens is for 5-10m 'sure" and then they'll say send me your résumé.
* Then they have your résumé & then you say "do you know anybody?"
* They'll forward your résumé to someone who's looking.
* Ask for permission to call someone. Don't cold call someone.


## Lines
* If it's just five minutes, keep it five minutes. Don't make it 30 minutes.
* Reach out to someone who has the title you're looking for. 
  * "Can I job shadow you..."


## How to ask
* Through LinkedIn - "hey, we're going to have an event. Would you mind talking?"


## Warnings
* Never ask for a job on your first interaction.
