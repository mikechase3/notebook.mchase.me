#### CompSci Response

I have been a software engineer at the GRILL for the last 2 years, responsible for managing STEM related activities at the Dayton Regional STEM School, mentoring a group of high-school students in Unreal Engine projects, and maintaining the website I created to highlight what we do.

I wear lots of different hats and love the fast pace of the job and the ability to innovate.

Most recently, I helped pioneer an unmanned drone event to engage more students than previously in our Full Throttle STEM program. It has been a huge success and led to dozens of more girls engaging in our programs.

### How to handle inappropriate questions

* It's probably in your best interest to deflect the question.
* If the interviewer is probing for irrelevant.
* "I don't think that's too relevant, but I would love to tell you about my programming experience"

> You could say something like: "Thanks, but I'm really here to talk about the job." He might take the hint and drop the obnoxious flirtation.

> If he really crosses the line, it may be worth your time to bring the bad behavior to the attention of others at the company.
