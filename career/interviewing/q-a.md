        <p>I have been a software engineer at the GRILL for the last 2 years, responsible
          for managing STEM related activities at the Dayton Regional STEM School,
          mentoring a group of high-school students in Unreal Engine projects, and
          maintaining the website I created to highlight what we do.</p>

        <p>I wear lots of different hats and love the fast pace of the job and the
          ability to innovate.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Most recently, I helped pioneer an unmanned drone event to engage more
          students than previously in our Full Throttle STEM program. It has been
          a huge success and led to dozens of more girls engaging in our programs.</p>
