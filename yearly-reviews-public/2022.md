# 2022

## February

### San Francisco Visit

* Went to San-Fran to see what culture is like and visit E.M. and S.P.
* Much-needed break from school burn-out.

### Superbowl Halftime Show

* They decided to be all 'woke' and pull rappers.
* They told Snoop Dog not to wear blue because it was associated with the [crips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crips) (gang).
* If they're trying to represent more black people, they choose
  * Snoop dog - who was high while performing.
  * Eminem - probably the cleanest
  * Dr. Dre - who probably killed people before.
* Michael Jackson did a halftime show. The information wasn't legitamate/public, but there was speculation that he was a [pedophile](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/30/real-michael-jackson-review-jacques-peretti); however, it was unconfirmed at the time.
* It's a tough line to toe. The culture was just a lot different back then.
