# Defining Propaganda

## Types of Propaganda

### White Propaganda

* They're about us.&#x20;
* Office of war and information
* Easily verified for accuracy.

### Black propaganda

* Hidden sources
* Death Cents Stamps. Where you completely falsify who is giving it.
* Office of war information. Anyone who looks at that would never see any recognition of who is sending it.
* Anti-Gurilla Campaigns. They don't know that's paid for by the CIA.

### Gray propaganda

* Most propaganda is gray.
* Most advertising.
* Product placement. If you stick to the very end, you'll see the product placement. But most people won't actually read that stuff.
