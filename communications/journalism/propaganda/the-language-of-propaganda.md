## Readings

* [We Become Propagandists Thomas Sorenson](https://isidore.udayton.edu/access/content/group/5dd671b3-7334-4d36-b659-edc7c01d020d/Lessons/Week%2008%20--%20\_10\_12-10\_18\_/We%20Become%20Propagadists%20\_Sorenson\_.pdf)



## Purpose

* Why is 75% lean beef better than 25% fat?
* What makes slogan so successful?



## Equivocation & Amphibology

* **Equivocation:** The same word can mean different things.
* Many words are **polysemous**, meaning they have many possible meanings.
* **Amphibology**: using ambiguity for benefit
  * Make predictions that cannot be wrong
  * Deceive without literally telling falsehood.

## Denotations vs Connotations

* We can add connotative meaning to a word.

## Language

1. Defining a problem
2. Code grooming
3. Euphemisms (weasel words)
4. God/Devil terms (name-calling)
5. Amphibology (glittering generalities)

### Glittering Generalities

* Using words that **make you feel good.**
* Use words that have positive connotations, but ambiguous meanings.
* _Let's make a kinder, gentle America_
* _We must support valiant freedom fighters._
* _We fight in defense of democracy_
* _Fresh water bottled from our purest mountain springs_

### God Terms

* An extreme version of glittering generalities.
* These are universaly positive and agreebable wording by appealing to universal human needs
* Belonging: friendship, love
* Safety: healthy, protect
* Esteem: Smart, beautiful
* Autonomy: freedom, individual

### Devil Terms

* Hateful
* Terrorist

### Name Calling

* Labeling the opponent in impossible-to-agree-with terms
* The boston **massacre**
* **War** on **Terror**
* Pro-choice & Pro-Life: _nobody is going to have an anti-choice shirt._&#x20;
* We need to **reduce violence** on television.

We're silenced in criticism when we use the word "terror."&#x20;

### Defining Problems by Naming Them

![Halitosis: bad breath.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (367).png>)

#### Ad Over Time

Listerine created this ad. Before this ad, nobody cared. This ad makes you care.

#### Athlete's Foot

This was pretty much invtented. It's baad. People don't want it.

#### Body Odor

* People smooked so much that you couldn't tell if people stunk.
* They had to make you care&#x20;

#### Light Beer

* It's not actually any healthier.
* It's just watered-down.
* You pay more for a crappier version of that product.&#x20;

### Euphemisms: Weakening word power

These words are almost too&#x20;

#### Collateral Damage

* Civilian deaths

#### Defensive Strike

* Replaces _bombing_

#### Strategic Withdrawal

_Replaces Retreat (ours)_

#### Tactical Redeployment

_Retreat (enemy's)_

#### Terminate

_Replaces Kill_

**Meltdown**

Unrequested fission surplus

### Weasel Words

Statements appear to be clear and concrete, but select words (often propositions) add nuance. It helps you maintain credibility while letting you infer the meaning.

* You _could have_ won $1,000,000!

### Code Grooming

* Use slang and language that your audience is used to hearing
* Use _insider language_ that your audience shares.
  * Find the jargon/terminology/slang used
  * Reformat your own language use.
* Helps the audience idnetify with the source
  * Enhances ETHOS
  * You can go have a beer with this guy.
* Intentional **dialiect** usage
  * Intentially putting ums and uhs so it looks like he's not reading off a teleprompter.
* Inside jokes & references.

## Strategies

### Tell a Story

* Stories are remembered much better&#x20;

## JUUL: Early Advertising

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (368).png>)

* The word JUUL doesn't imply this is invented to help people quit cigarettes.
* Shows _super happy fun-time_
* Fitting in the crowd.
* The word **vaporized** is a _**euphemism**_ for smoking.&#x20;
* JUUL is not trying to tell us to smoke because smoking is bad. Vaping kinda sounds cool. The old people don't know how it works.
* It does not look like the bad things.

#### Implies

* It's cool.
* Buy this product. It does this thing you've never heard of.

## Jay Walking

* The complete fabrication of jaywalking.
* The idea that jay walking is a problem is completely fabricated.
* Rich people didn't want to look bad for mowing down peasants with their 2-ton vehicles.&#x20;
  * Editorials
  * Newspaper caroons
* Jay: red neck, folks out on the farm.
  * Only stupid, ignorant, uncultured Jays don't get out of the way of the car.&#x20;
  * They get mowed down.
  * By painting the literal victim of a crime as a country bumpkin, you make people ashamed and feel bad that they got in the way of someone who couldn't control their car.
