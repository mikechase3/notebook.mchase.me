# Breaking Up Gracefully

## Breakup Considerations

Your approach depends on what you want to accomplish:

* Spare their feelings?
* Do you value honestly to the point that you'd yell at them for barking up the wrong tree?
* Do you want it to be easy, or are you willing to engage? (You could lie/euphemizing  some degree?)
* How well do you know them??
  * Fake phone number for rejecting: 212-479-7990
* Do you want them to follow-up with you?
  * Outline specific reasons for rejection
  * Give tips for success.
