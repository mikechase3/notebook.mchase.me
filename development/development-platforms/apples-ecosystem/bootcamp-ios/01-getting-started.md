# 01 Getting Started

## How Apps Work

### Event Driven

1. **User Interface**: display photos/text/whatever;
2. **Code**: handles user interaction. Plan what happens when they use a slider.
3. **Data**: goes into data & fetches it.

### iOS Requires you to Handle Events:

1. Calls will send interrupts to your code.
2. When battery is low, unexpected behavior might occur if your app is using too many resources.

## Tools & Materials

You'll need a macbook, but you can also rent one on the cloud & connect to it via RDP like [macincloud](https://www.macincloud.com) or AWS.
