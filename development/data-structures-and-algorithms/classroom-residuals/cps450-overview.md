# CPS 450 Overview

## About This Course

1. More detailed algorithms
2. Divide and conquor techniques.
3. Greedy Algorithms
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Linear Programming: _Using linear functions to solve problems_
6. NP Complete Problems _and how to find approximations_

## Why is this useful?

1. More complicated problems
2. **Routing** _for weights when theyâ€™re really complicated. Routing describes how nodes are connected._
3. Scheduling
4. Caching: _Servers each data to reduce the time & delay, but what should you cache?._
5. Resource Allocation
6.  Teaches us how to solve new problems.

    **Understanding Dynamic Programming**
7. Find solutions to smaller problems
8. Save it somewhere.
9. Increase the problem size by 1, but use the previous solution in your new solution.

## Internet Routing

1. Fnid the shortest path from a computer in UD to a computer somewhere in Europe.
2. When the graphs are small, it's easy to solve it.
3. When the graph is large, the global is unknown.
4. **Dijkstra's Algorith:** is used to find the shortest path.

## Other Examples

1. Decentralized where each router knows physically connected neighbors.
2. Link costs to neighbors are considered.
3. Bellmand-Ford algorithm are uesd.

## Dynamic Graphs

1. In CPS 350 we used static graphs.
2. What if it's **Dynamic** and changes quickly?

## Further Practice

1. Leetcode: _Median of Two Sorted Arrays_ (Solveable only by divide/conquer.)
