# List iOS Tablet Applications

## Lost Hamlet Monologue

I've had a strong love of tablets in my life from way before they were cool. I remember literally shedding a tear or two when I saw how awesome the software was on iOS iPads were, and while I wished there was more I/O like a USB port I liked the concept a lot.

Anyways, I couldn't afford an iPad because those were expensive, so I had this loong series of trading up like one of those business games you play as a kid when you take something useless from your parents house like some gift coffee mug that's still in a box that's been sitting around for the last 9-months that nobody knows what to do with because we have enough mugs and we're trying to re-gift it or bring it to our family's annual "gifts-nobody-wants-games" Christmas event.
