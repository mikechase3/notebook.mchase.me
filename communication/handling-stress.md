# Handling Stress

## Cycles of Anxiety & Depression

### Cycles of Anxiety

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (440).png>)

* It often occurs as a cycle.
* **Avoidance**: It's really effective short-term, but increases in the long-term.

### Cycles of Depression

* You'll have cycles of increased and decreased activity.
* To intervene, engage in _behavioral activation_ and avoid depressed behaviors (like doing nothing).

### The Cognitive Model

* Situation: I'm walking to class and I smile at them, but they don't acknowledge me.
  * If someone has social anxiety, you might think that there's something wrong with you or think that they hate you.
  * Feelings: anxious, sadness, worthless.
  * Behavior: seek more assurance from friend, avoid them in social situations altogether (which ramps up anxiety).

## Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Unhelpful thinking patterns

### Black and White Thinking

* **Example:** if I'm not perfect, I have failed.
* **Problems**: it doesn't leave you space to actually solve the problems. Maybe the professor sucks, but you think you're a failure.&#x20;

### Catastrophizing

* **Definition:** Thinking about the worst-case scenario.
* **Example:** I need to learn this information and if I don't, my GPA will drop, and then I'll never get my degree, and then I'll be homeless living under a bridge.

### Compare and Despair

* Sometimes it's helpful to compare yourself to other people.
* Oftentimes, it puts you in a tough spot to have a positive relationship with yourself.

### Critical Self

### Emotional Reasoning

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (441).png>)

* When you have real intense emotions.
* Instead of approaching it rationally.

### Judgements

* Being hard on yourself.

### Mind Reading

* **Example**: If someone is very silent with you, you might think you're boring or an idiot.
  * Problem: These assumptions are only one possibility of many.
  * Ask: Do you have enough evidence to support this hypothesis?
* **Example:** My friend didn't smile at me. They must hate me.

### Prediction

* Assuming a future outcome in a negative frame.
* **Example**: If I go to the party, nobody will talk to me and everyone will hate me so I won't go.

### Should, Could, Would

* Should-ofs are not very helpful.
* Your reactions are just reactions, not necessarily the reality.
