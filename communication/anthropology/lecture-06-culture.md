# Lecture 06: Culture

## Defining Culture in an Anthropological Context

* Culture is **learned behavior**.
  * What do we learn as members of a cultural group?

### Differences between Sociology

* Anthropology deals with the whole of the human condition whilist sociologist only care about modern humans.
* Sociologists are more domestic, while anthropologists deal with culture and trying to explain it \(not society\).
* themes like race and gender are similar; however, anthropologists take a more fundamental approach. 

## Culture Non-Human Species

* Other species celebrate culture, but it's simple.
* Humans are the only people with **fully developed culture.**
  * We put hierarchies and establish etticuittes and rate restaurants.
  * We're the only species that put stars on hotels.

## Human Culture Characteristics

* Traditions are passed won between generations.
* Culture is **symbolic**: 
  * Example: we put symbolism behind colors.
* Holistic and Integrated: influences everything in our life
  * Education, politics, and chain reactions...
* **Controls Nature**: like time-stamps or calendars.
  * We take a natural landscape and apply rules to it.
  * We put stop-lights around and people actually stop at them.

## Changing Culture

* TV/Shows and movies change around a lot.
* Masks is a world-wide social norm nowadays. \(Being contested - but a lot more normal\).

## Enculturation

* The process of learning a culture throughout our lives.
* Foundations begin in early childhood, but never stops.
* We belong to many cultures throughout our lives.
  * Age group culture
  * Ethnic culture
  * Hobby culture \(renaissance fair\).

## Cultural Relativism

### Slavery and Culture Acceptableness

* Should all cultures be treated as equally acceptable?
* You have to understand the culture according to it's own logic. 

Culture relativism is methodological. We seek to understand why it occurred and the processes it occured in a non-judgemental way. Then we take a moral stance.
