# Grouping and Tribalism

## Us vs Them

* Propaganda likes to separate groups.
* In agonism, the goal is to emphasize conflict between two parties as a normal good thing.

## The Granfaloon Technique

### What is it?

* People are most likely to support & share resources/agree with others in their groups.
  * They will sacrifice personal losses in exchange for group gains.
* This happens even if the group association is entirely random and meaningless.
  * Teams assigned as odd/even teams.
  * Which school you identify with.
  * UD as identifying as a _flyer_.

### Why does it work?

* We use group association to divide up & make sense of the world.
* Differences between groups are exaggerated.
  * Similarities among members are emphasized.
  * Demonizing "the other"
*
