# Hollywood Cinema

## Manipulative

* Cinema is so manipulative
* Completely monologic control over a message and audience
* There's a forced and subjective perspective
* Montage creates narrative and ideological associations
* Cinema creates shared cultural mythos

## Cameras are Subjective Points of View

## Kuleshov Effect

* Putting things together makes meaning.
* Shots gain further meaning when placed near other shots. Relationship is assumed.

## Batman

#### Crimes Committed

* Shooting, explosions.

#### Crimes not Committed

* Tax fraud.
* What is the way of stopping crime?

#### Conclusion

* Batman is the story of rich people throwing a mask on and punching mentally ill people and locking them away.
* There's no investing in good additional mental health agencies.
* No talk about intervention in schools, people wouldn't grow up to have freeze-rays.

## Daffy Duck: Der Fuehrer's



## Assignment

* Take a movie
* Break it down as a potential piece of propaganda.
* Pick a subtle one, not Rocky. 
  * Best one: Elf, an ideological breakdown.
