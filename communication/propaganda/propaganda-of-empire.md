# Propaganda of Empire

## Public Relations vs Propaganda

* They're the exact same thing.
* Propaganda gets a very bad name after WWI and WWII, so the US branded it as _public relations_.

## Spanish-American War

### Focus on Domestic Growth

* Heavy traiffs \(and partial embargos\) minimize any foreign trade.
* Immigrants had little desire to deal wtih the 'Old World'

### Importance of Mass Media

* Emergence of \*national\* newspaper chains. 
  * Powerful, influential publishers \(Hearst, Pulitzer\)

### The 'Shadow of the Civil War'

* Leadership is passing from venerated vetrans to their children.

### Questioning Gender Politics & Policies

* Beginnings of sufferage.

### Fears

There are some cultural wars. 

* Racial identity
* Massculinity
* American Exceptionalism

### Main Idea

1. Lots of factors are persuading Americans that war is dumb.
   1. Americans like being left alone.

## Demonizng the Spansish

## Delegitamize Opposition to War

* Anyone who resists _going and directly fighting with military action is:_
  * Weak, ineffectual, and spineless.
* William McKinely shouldn't be mocked as a peaceloving wuss.
  * He was led into combad in the civil war.
  * One of the reason he doesn't want to fight is that he realizes wawr is miserable.

## Stand Up for Other Countries

* The role of the US is to stand-up for other countries.
* If we don't do this, someone worse will take advantage of the situation.
