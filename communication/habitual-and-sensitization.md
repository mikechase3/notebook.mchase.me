# Habitual and Sensitization

* “**Potentiation**” refers to a strengthening of a nerve synapse. Long-term potentiation is based on the principle that “cells that fire together, wire together,” and is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning and memory.
* **Habituation** occurs when we learn **not to respond to a stimulus** that is presented repeatedly without change, punishment, or reward.
* **Sensitization** occurs when a reaction to a stimulus causes an **increased reaction to a second stimulus**. It is essentially an exaggerated startle response and is often seen in trauma survivors.
* During habituation, fewer neurotransmitters are released at the synapse. In sensitization, however, there are more pre-synaptic neurotransmitters, and the neuron itself is more excitable.
