# Balancing Normalness

## What Really Isn't Quirky & Unique?

{% embed url="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3erzoz/what_do_people_think_makes_themselves_quirky_and/" %}

* Saying you're quirky and unique.
* Talking about fandom/Disney.
* Being so important they inspire envy with their **haters**.
* "I don't care what anyone thinks, I speak my mind and if you don't like it that's tough."
  * Means you're actually an asshole.
  * It's a free pass for being rude all the time and spinning disregard for other people's feelings into a positive personality trait. 
* "I'm just being honest"
  * No you're just being cruel.
* I'm so "bipolar, OCD, anxiety"
*
