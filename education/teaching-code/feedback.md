Virtual turtle lesson

12:45 – 1:50 pm

Try to re-structure the lesson. In general, it should go something like this:

&#x20;

Planning

·         Define the SWBAT for the end of the lesson.

·         By the end of the lesson, Students Will Be Able To \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

·         Make sure it is reasonable to expect them to have mastered this by the end of the lesson.

·         Example: SWBAT independently name and explain the uses of the 5 functions covered in class with 80% accuracy.

·         Bad example: SWBAT independently create a picture using python turtle. \[This is too broad.]

&#x20;

Before the Lesson

·         Make sure students have a copy of guided notes

·         Make sure students have all necessary files downloaded

&#x20;

Activate Prior Schema

·         Activate schema by creating review slides about the things they should already know

·         Interior angles in a triangle

·         Pythagorean theorem

·         Functions

·         Coordinate planes

·         The origin

·         Angle measures

&#x20;

“I Do” (Modeling)

·         Create a shape and explain your steps as you do it

·         Be clear, concise, and direct. Don’t talk more than you need to.

·         Speak with authority

·         Sound like you find this topic the most interesting topic ever (even if you don’t). Kids will feed off your energy

&#x20;

“We Do” (Guided Instruction)

·         Ask questions about what to do next. Call on students, if necessary.

·         Make a mistake and try to get them to catch it. If they don’t, say, “Oh, I did something silly here. Does anyone see the mistake I made?”

·         Get them to talk as much as possible.

&#x20;

“You Do” (Independent Instruction)

·         Students should work on their own with little support from you.

·         Things they’re working on should be very similar to problems from guided instruction with no new knowledge necessary.

·         If a student finishes early, you can give them an extension activity (i.e., a slightly harder problem that doesn’t require new knowledge but is more complex. Instead of a house with a chimney, make a starburst, etc).

&#x20;

Review

·         Go over everything you have learned. This should be similar to guided learning but much faster and only once or twice.

&#x20;

Practice times should be shorter. 10 minutes is a long gap – try 2 minutes. If you’re able to show a stopwatch, that may be helpful, as well.

&#x20;

Make sure students are filling out guided notes based on what you’re saying. You shouldn’t fill out the guided notes because then they don’t have to listen, they’ll just copy what you’re writing.

&#x20;

Speak with authority! I’m sure you’re nervous but just remember, if you make a mistake, the kids won’t know that. Be intentional and declarative in everything you say.

&#x20;

Try to avoid using the chat. Ask the students multiple choice questions and have them respond using the “react” option. On the screen, show the question with a couple possible answers and the emoji that corresponds. Kids can select the emoji from the react option. You will get more engagement this way. It also makes them feel safer because their (potentially) wrong answer won’t be sitting in the chat for everyone to see for long periods of time.

&#x20;

Be explicit in your instructions:

I need you to open the program.

Use the forward and angle functions to create a square.

I’m going to give you one minute. (This prevents them from struggling for too long and it will keep them from getting frustrated and giving up.)

&#x20;

Encourage them to have physical, paper copies of the notes. Writing them down helps encode them in their memory. (There is a lot of research on this.)

&#x20;

If you don’t get volunteers, feel free to just call on kids. Especially if you’re going to have everyone share their work.

&#x20;

&#x20;

Overall, the kids seemed interested. Some of their drawings were really amazing.

&#x20;

It was interesting that they began writing loops on their own. They did great!

Good lesson, Mike! Keep it up!
