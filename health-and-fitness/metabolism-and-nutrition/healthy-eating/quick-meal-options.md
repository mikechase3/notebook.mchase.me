## Dinners

* **Baked (meat):** could be fish, chicken and/or pork (chop) breaded and baked, or just baked. Best when bought fresh and cooked within a day or two of purchase. If frozen, follow directions on box. You can look up recipies, but rule of thumb season w salt, pepper and garlic powder (onion powder, etc.) and bake until "done" (meaning fish is flaky, meat is no longer red, pork and chicken show no pink at all.) Fish 400 to 425, steak 375 to 400, chicken and pork, 325-350.
* **Pizza:** w mozzarella cheese, frozen crust, pizza sauce (spaghetti sauce if none), and VEGETABLES including onion, mushroom, garlic, green pepper, red pepper, bell pepper, etc.&#x20;
* **Mexican:** fry up ground beef (or other ground meat), have a Mexican Seasoning pack, get the meat good and brown, then usually drain the fat, add the seasoning and a cup of water, and a simmer on low heat for 10 minutes or whatever the seasoning packet says. Then maybe heat up your shells so they are soft, add lettuce, cut up tomato/onion/pepper. Sour cream, salsa on top.&#x20;
  * In another pan, heat up some beans refried beans, black beans, red beans, whatever. Sides you have instant mashed potatoes, there are also instant grits (near oatmeals) and a couple other instant grain-type sides (add butter to add flavor). Also, rice, quinoa, cous cous.&#x20;
* **Vegetables:** You have carrots in bags and I got you four corn on the cob (acts more like a grain or bread than a vegetable, but ok). Also, frozen veggies will usually be your best way to go.
* **Steak:** It is not cheap but it's fairly easy especially in cast iron pan. Put on top of stove on med-high salt pepper garlic and spices small bit of butter in pan sear one side (about 3 min) then flip and sear other side, then well, the way I would do it, you would take entire pan and put in oven at 400 for about ten minutes (check it at 7) until the color of the meat is dim red (medium). Unless you want rare (still pink but ends brown) or well done (all brown). You can also continue to pan fry it for around 6-7 minutes a side and skip the oven part, especially if you cover it while frying.&#x20;
* **Chili:** good guy dish. Fry your meat until brown, adding salt/pepper/garlic powder/onion powder, put into a pot once the meat is all brown. Add packet of chili seasoning, or else find an online chili powder recipe (more work). Cut up onion, green and red pepper, couple cloves of garlic and a can of beans (Great Northern, White, or Pinto). Low simmer for 45 minutes to an hour. Crackers good.
