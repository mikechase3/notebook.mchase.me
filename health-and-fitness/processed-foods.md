# Processed Foods

**Processed foods** are any raw agricultural commodity \[product] that has been subject to processing, such as canning, cooking, freezing, dehydrating, or milling (as defined by USGA)

**Benefits**: they are time-savers in-comparison to preparing eals. They provide important nutrients. Processing can destroy/inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. It also delays the spoilage of food.

**Hazards**: it's a contributor to the obesity epidemic. It goes hand-in-hand with blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Many nutrients can be destroyed/removed like high in sodium, saturated fats, trans fats, added sugars.

## Dietary Guideline Limits

1. Added sugars should make up less than 10% of daily calories
2. Saturated fats should be < 10%
3. As little trans-fats as possible. It's mostly illegal these days.
4. Sodium should be less than 2300mg/day.&#x20;

## Categories

### Unprocessed or minimially processed foods

* Cleaning or removing inedible/unwanted parts
* Freezing/fermenting
* **Conclusion**: no major changes

### Processed Culinary Ingredients

* Pressing, refining, grinding, milling
* Flower is an example of a processed culinary ingredient.

### Processed Foods

* Foods from either of the two previous groups w/ extra salt, sugar, or fats

### Ultra-Processed Foods

* What we normally associate processed foods with.
* Artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives
* Promotes shelf stability
* Preserves texture
* Increases palatability

## Nutrition Labels

### Micronutrients

* Stick to vitamin D, calcium, Iron, and potassium.

### Ingredients list

* Listed in descending of predominance

#### Questions to consider

1. How many ingredients are listed?
2. Where on the list does ingredients appear?
3. How many types of sugar are listed?
   1. High fructose corn syrup.
   2. Agave-nectar
   3. Baley malt syrup
   4. Sucralose/Sucrose
4. Any trans-fats?

## Food Additives

There are two types: **direct** food additives are added for a specific purpose like how sugar is added for sweetness. Others prevent separation of ingredients. **Indirect food additives** became a part of food in trace amounts due to packaging, storage, and other additives.  The FDA tracks it to ensure there aren't many.&#x20;

The purpose of food/color additives maintain the safety/freshness, improve/maintain nutritional value, or improve the taste/texture/appearance of food.&#x20;

### Common Food Additives

1. Anti-caking: prevents moisture in caking & certain types of foods. It comes from aluminum phosphate.
2. Flavor enhancers: a lot of them if you read nutrition labels, they sound like elements on the periodic table. Monosodium gluconate
3. Fat replacers: made from carbohydrates like cellulose, gellatin, different types of gums.&#x20;
4. Humectants: these help keep moisture & things from drying out. Sugar, salt, honey, mollasses, syrups.&#x20;
5. Nutrients: iron-oxide, magnesium sulfate are popular.
6. Preservatives: citric acid, ascorbic acid, sodium benzoate
7. Stabilizers/thickeners: Zanthem gum, modified food starch. These are thickening agencies & make things take up more volume in a container. It's a way companies save money and makes things look bigger without it taking up more product.
8. Sweeteners: Splenda, sucralose, aspartame

### Color Additives

These enhance natural colors, add color to colorless foods, and help identify flavors. Our eyesight associates colors with flavors, so if we didn't have them, lot of our flavor would be colorless. For example, mint chocolate-chip ice cream has no green food coloring and people think it's weird that weird.

## Organic

* All it means that the product was created under humane circumstances without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or other artificial agents.
* The FDA will test the soil around where the products grow.&#x20;
* FDA also makes sure animals aren't fed antibiotics/hormones/etc.&#x20;
* Beware - it has to have the [USDA-Certified label](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i\&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usda.gov%2Ftopics%2Forganic\&psig=AOvVaw1lHAoNyLi\_L-2fe-hSijQ4\&ust=1675358898246000\&source=images\&cd=vfe\&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCOCcx7Ls9PwCFQAAhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=i\&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usda.gov%2Ftopics%2Forganic\&psig=AOvVaw1lHAoNyLi\_L-2fe-hSijQ4\&ust=1675358898246000\&source=images\&cd=vfe\&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCOCcx7Ls9PwCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAEAAAdAAAAABAE) on it.&#x20;

## Grains

### Whole Grains are Better than Refined Grains

* Process beings on a farm. Kernels are planted, grown, and harvested as wheat.
* During processing, the purpose is to&#x20;
* Refined flour: has the endosperm & brand removed. The flour gets bleached & later on more nutrients get added to it, but they recommend the least amount of processing flower can go through, which is your whole-wheat option.&#x20;
* **Refined grains** are processed to remove the bran/germ. It improves shelf-life and has a finer texture, but lacks fiber, iron, and B-vitamins.
* **Recommendations**: Ezekiel (frozen) & Dave's Killer Bread are recommended.

## Ad

* **Wheat bread**: made from the grain wheat. (Most brads)
* **White bread**: went through milling process & removed the healthy parts and was bleached and the nutrients came back in the fortifying process.
* **Multi-grain bread**: contains more than one grain. You have to be careful because some of the grains could have been stripped of the nutrients when going through the milling process still.&#x20;
* **100% whole grain bread**: contains the whole grain kernel. The best option.&#x20;

## Advertising Scams

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>In order for companies to make these claims, they have to have the above qualifications.</p></figcaption></figure>

* There is a code of federal regulations that claims something is a "good source of" as long as it contains 10-19% of your daily value.
* **Potato Chips**: they like to market it as a food that's low in cholesterol, but cholesterol comes from animal-products. That's a trick they like to swindle their buyers but there's no cholesterol to begin with.
* Candy is all sugar, but companies put "low-fat" on it, so that's another way they can get you.
