* People at TSR learned when they have a deadline, they'll say "what do we got on?" and they'd write what came out of his mouth.
* Went to school with all races. He was raised by 2 grandmas operating as a shift-clerk? 
  * Women to him were authority figures. 
  * Ladiies ran everything in the library so he put that in the realms. 
  * So it was in tandem with the way society was moving at the time.
  * Nerds who grew up with censorship, where fantasy was 'naughty', those guys grew up and made movie studios. 
  * Nerds took over the world & he was born and lived in the right time to watch it.
  * No flush toilets, no electricity at homes, no paved roads, no electric plates.
* Such a drastic change in the world. Go explore more! Never stop traveling/exploring.
* What was it like to be presented with mysterious items like 'forgotten realms' and fantastic titles where you can discover all sorts of things? What was his reaction?
  * Maps aren't as impressive as I thought they did.
  * He had 'power'. F-ing hexes and rivers and whatever that follow hexes.

  * He likes it. 
  * He works in a public library in the country as a retiree.
  * Ed's got a movie! Ed's got a movie! Assumed he written the movie.
  * he's seen it 8 times & it stands up that many.
  * Flippant light move that someone who doesn't know it will have a good time sitting through.
* Working on now?
  * Relams Lore
  * Youtube Channel.
  * Suspect elecctrical service & internet.

  * Blackmail w/ NPC. "It'd be a pity if I told the King"
  * Make NPCs. At least one per building, h ave a dirty secret.
* Wrote "The One Eyed King". A funnny novel Mby Michelle Franklin" wrote something recently.
* Hates rule-lawyers. Preffers the charity tables to run and didn't know DnD. Wanted to play & have a good time. Not learn it.
  * What was the dice for? "Oh, that would be telling"
* Favorite DnD in the realms: I don't play favorites because I can't play favorites. 
  * Taikee or Time Auora is more playable.
  * Tempest the bables is more deployable for battles.
  * Does lots of stuff on Malar the beast lord.
  * People love "The Drown" or "The Ron"?
  * Available to look up on YouTube. 
  * "The Forgotten Realms"
* People coming up with things you wouldn't have done. Just roll with it?
* Writers: what would be your hardest roadblock in your career? How would you tell aspiring writers to overcome them?
  * Writing has changed so much when he started.
  * When he started, there was no internet. There was little self-publishing.
  * You had to give it to them on consignment.
  * There were limited numbers of publishers within reach. lots of small publishers with special niches.
  * Try to service their markets.
  * Big four publishers Simon/Schuster, Harper/Colins/Rode, Randomhouse/Penguin, Tour (McMillian), 
  * Now, anybody can self-publish. Amazon might end up owning it so watch out though.
  * Nowadays, you are in Atlanta Airport going buy my book and now getting noticed in that crowd is hard.
  * Homosexuality was not to be spoken of when he wrote his first novel. Called "Fool's Master" and flogged it & sold out.
  * Be bullet-proof. They'll cover them with their bodies. Accidnet, discovered by somebody. 
  * Long way: grow your fans of over 25+ years and writing about what they want to read. Go to conventions.
  * And when they take off like Star Wars fandom, it'll take off? 
  * Do a book you're proud of, and relentlessly market it yourself in each thing. Get on a panel and say I'm writing the next one.
  * to create something in the world & share ideas is the 'most honorable prrofession'.
