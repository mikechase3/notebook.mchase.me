        failing fast and learning to recover from their failures.</td>

      <td style="text-align:left">Tim</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Tim challenged every argument I made, even if he agreed with it. 80% of
        the time, I was passionate about my point of view, but forgotten how I
        developed it and failed to explain how I reached that conclusion. I criticized
        a headset cleaner at work because I didn&apos;t believe UV killed viruses
        and infections, but didn&apos;t have sophisticated evidence to back it
        up. I told Tim about how I used AI to write many portions of my papers,
        but he challenged my code of ethics and specifically my integrity. I told
        him people would hate me if I assign them tasks in JIRA, and I learned
        to stop exaggerating to make a point or explicitly warn them how I&apos;m
        going to exaggerate something. Tim taught me to not re-invent the wheels,
        even if it was more efficient to do so like sharing government files via
        Dropbox to avoid our office getting into trouble. Even though dropbox and
        cloud services are more efficient (and acceptable for non-classified documents
        at times), I should behave as others should. Finally, Tim believed me using
        three monitors and two computers was inefficient and was a waste of resources.
        He turned out to be right on that. Not only did I learn that more monitors
        doesn&apos;t make me more productive, but I learned the value of giving
        and accepting criticism - even for things that do not seemingly matter.</td>
