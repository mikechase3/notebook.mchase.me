# Don't Do Drugs

Drugs and alcohol are bad and it's almost a principle of mine. Here are reasons to remind myself that I don't need to turn to these:



## Alcohol

* Put a piano in front of you first.
* if you have homework, you're not going to get it done any faster.&#x20;

## Weed

* "Don't believe whatever the stoners write on the label. The focus cart won't make you any more focused."
