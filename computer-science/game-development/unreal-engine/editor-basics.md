## Content Browser

* Keeps track of everything in your project; not particularily in that level.
* Color click by right clicking folders and hitting color. Nice for organization.
* **Filters**: You can change what type of thing you want to filter by.
* _**Toggle Lock**_: Protects your directory from changing when you're navigating the file tree.
* When importing files, go to `File -> Import`. Don't just put it in the asset directory.
* _**Developer:**_ A scratch folder. Enable it by right clicking in the browser and hitting show developer.
* _**Collections**_: They're like tags. You can drag and drop things that you want to tag as rocks.
  * It's a static collection.
  * Use filters instead if you want things to dynamically update.
