* Graphics card are really good at multiplying/adding.
* ****[**Fused Multiply-Add**](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Fused-Multiply-Add-FMA-work-and-what-is-its-importance-in-computing)**:** (A+B)\*(C+D)
  * Important for computing dot products.

### Specular and Diffuse Reflection

* **Diffuse** lighting comes from the light to the surface.
* **Specular** light reflects only certain wavelengths off the surface.

* Dot product of two vectors gives you a fused multiply add.
* A vector is a direction and a magnitude.
* Dot product is the percentage of one vector in another vector.
