## Branches

* I didn't take any notes for this part.

## User Interfaces

### MEAN Full Stack

1. MongoDB
2. Express.js
3. AngularJS (or Angular)
4. Node.js

Web pages are text files in plaintext, written as an HTML document.

* Contains plaintext content and markup.

## Scripting Programming Languages

* Javascript

### Documents

* Data is stored in documents.&#x20;
* Stored in a way which is efficient for people to process.
* You can add data when you need to quickly and efficiently.
* Fault tolerances

### Management Tools

* MongoDB is good for the cloud.
* Available on AWS, Microsoft Azure. Through other interfaces.

### Resources

* Bradley will be the lead for HTML/CSS/[Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE)

## Node.JS

* It's a platform built on Chrome's Javascript runtime
* Used for easily building fast & scalable network applications.

### How to learn

* nodejs.dev
* Youtube: Node.js Tutorial for Beginners
* Udemy.coom
* Nodeschool.io
* Nodetuts.com

### How to use it

* Chatbot with Node JS Example
* Create a basic express application starting by creating the application, enter lines in your tutorial
* Add some useful packages
* Add logic

## Express.JS

* A node JS web application server framework
* Specifically designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

### How to learn it

* Youtube is the best way
* It's not very hard to learn. It'll take a day or two.

## Javascript

### Resources

* [Cheat sheet with some basic stuff.](https://www.htmlcheatsheet.com/js)
* Javascript for beginners
* Build a Chat App with MongoDB & Socket.io

## Socket.io

* A javascript library for realtime web applications
* It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients & servers
* 2 parts: client-side library that runs in the browser
* Server-side library for Node.JS
