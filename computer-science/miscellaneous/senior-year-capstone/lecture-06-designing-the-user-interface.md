## Branches

* I didn't take any notes for this part.

## User Interfaces

### MEAN Full Stack

1. MongoDB
2. Express.js
3. AngularJS \(or Angular\)
4. Node.js

### Documents

* Data is stored in documents. 
* Stored in a way which is efficient for people to process.
* You can add data when you need to quickly and efficiently.
* Fault tolerances

### Management Tools

* MongoDB is good for the cloud.
* Available on AWS, Microsoft Azure. Through other interfaces.

* Add some useful packages
* Add logic

## Express.JS

* A node JS web application server framework
* Specifically designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

### How to learn it

* Youtube is the best way
* It's not very hard to learn. It'll take a day or two.

## Javascript

### Resources

* [Cheat sheet with some basic stuff.](www.htmlcheatsheet.com/js)
* Javascript for beginners
