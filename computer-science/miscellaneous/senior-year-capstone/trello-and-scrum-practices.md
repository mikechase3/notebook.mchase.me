# Lecture 04: Requirement Engineering

## SCRUM Purpose

* SCRUM helps you develop in a team.
* **Project Backlog**: a prioritized list of user requirements for your project. What are the requirements?
* **Product Owner: **The owner is the person controlling the backlog
* **Scrum Master**: The project manager. 

## SCRUM Cycles (Sprints)

SCRUM is controlled by tight, smaller projects.

### Backlog & Team Planning

* Choose what to do from the Sprint Backlog
* Move the item in the backlog to the_ sprint backlog_
* You want a working prototype after the 30-day cycle.

### Popular SCRUM tools

* nTask
* Jira: _what we use at Air Force Research Labs_
* TargetProcess
* Trello: worse, but free.

### Required Lists

| List            | Purpose                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Product Backlog | Keeps the backlog of the whole project. (Requirements) |
| Sprint Backlog  | Keeps a backlog of the current sprint.                 |
| In-Progress     | Tasks which are being performed                        |
| Completed       | Keeps completed cards.                                 |

### Gnatt Charts

Gnatt charts are bar charts which illustrate a project schedule. We set a start and end date for each task card.

#### Extensions

* Power-Ups within Trello
* Elegantt Chrome Extension (doesn't work as well)



## Plans for Development

### The Software Process

1. **Specification**: Define what the system should do.
2. **Design and Implementation: **defining the organization of the system and implementing the system
3. **Validation: **checking that it does what the
4. **Evolution: **changing the system in response to changing customer needs.

### Plan-Driven & Agile Processes

* Plan-driven processes are processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan.
* In agile processes, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements.
* In practice, most practical processes include elements of both plan-driven and agile approaches. 
* There are no right or wrong software processes.

### Rapid Software Development





## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements are statements of services the system should provide, how the system should react to particular inputs, and how the system should behave in particular situations. It also may state what the system should not do.

* The requirements that your system needs.
* Hardware-based.
* Write it in the description.
* I need a _mouse_ and _keyboard_.

### Non-Functional Requirements

* **Definition: **constraints on the services or functions offered by the system such as timing constraints, constraints on the development process, standards, etc.
* They often apply to the system as a whole rather than individual features or services.
  * Security or performance.

## Agile Methods and Requirements

* Don't produce detailed system requirements because they change so quickly.
  * The requirements document is therefore always out of daye
* Use incremental requirements engineering.

## Models and Modeling

### What are models?

**Models: **a representation of some aspect of the system being built. Types of models:

### Types of Models

* Textual Model: something written down & described.
* Graphical models: diagram/schematic
* Mathematical models: Formulas, statistics, algorithms

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)

* Standard graphical modeling systems/terminology used for information systems.
