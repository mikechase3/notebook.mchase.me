# GitLab CICD Pipeline

## Project

* [https://gitlab.com/devops457](https://gitlab.com/devops457)

## Describe Ci/CD

* Automates software development and testing.
* Replace the team of people with a set of files that do things for you.

### Continuous Integration

* Test code every step of the way.
* Push small chunks to your application's codebase hosted in a Git repository.
* Automated tests check the developer's code.
* No \*but it works on my computer\*
* Accurate & reproducible testing.

### Continuous Delivery

* Requires a human to deploy the product into the production environment.
* Predictable, routine, and performed on demand.
* You can go to the CI pipeline and say "I want that product right now." You should be able to get it in minutes.

### Continuous Deployment

* It is automatically deployed to your environment.
* Uses a script to deploy auto

## &#x20;Why Use It?

* Reproducability

## The GitLab CI/CD Pipeline

* Built into GitLab
* No 3rd party applications or integrations needed.
* No time on spend maintaining.
* Integrates with other features in Gitlab.

## Unit Tests

* Unit tests test the functionality.

## Linting Test

* Linting checks formatting.&#x20;
* Functions cannot be overcomplicated.
* How many environment errors are you using?
* Prevents you from making things too complicated.

## Release Image

* Once all of the tests pass, you're left with a deliverable.
