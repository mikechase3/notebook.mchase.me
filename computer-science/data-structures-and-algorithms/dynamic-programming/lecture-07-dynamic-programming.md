## The Longest Common Subsequence Problem

### The Problem

Given 2 sequences (shown below), find a subsequence common to both whose length is _longest_.

$$
X=\{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\} \text{ and } Y=\{y_1, y_2, ... y_n\}
$$

{% hint style="warning" %}
A subsequence doesn't have to be consecutive, but it has to be in order.
{% endhint %}

### The Solutions

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Brute Force" %}
So the run time is pretty bad. I didn't write out how to do it, but Dr. Yao says it's:



$$
T=O(2^n)
$$

Because there are n letters, there are `2^n` subsequences, worst case.&#x20;

### Sub Problems

When we want to break a problem into smaller sub-problems, oftentimes, we **start at the end** and work backwards. Let's look at an example. Say we have two substrings: `size = lcs("aab", "azb")`.

When we work backwards, we'll start at the ending character, and we see `b` is common in both terms. So what do we do? We say `size = 1+lcs("aa", "az")` and continue down recursively. When we call `lcs("aa", "az")`, we have two options:

1. `lcs("a", "az")`
2. `lcs("aa", "a")`

Here's what we did. We looked at the very ending of the two characters, `a` and `z` and noticed that they're not the same. So, we now try removing one of the characters and solving the problem, and then, we'll try the opposite problem and compare their longest substrings. We'll want to find the maximum, largest common given these options. Whichever of these calls gives us a longer substring, we're going to take that as the largest and add it to `1` in the stack frame. We're cutting off character by character by character, and we want to see _what's the longest subsequence when we cut off different characters?_ **The final recursive call looks like: `size = 1 + max(lcs("a", "az"), lcs("aa", "a"))`**

#### The Left Half

So, recursively of course, we now look at smaller problems and there are again two cases:

`max(lcs("<empty>", "az"), lcs("a", "a"))`. After cutting off one character from both cases and comparing the maximum, we find that going with `a` is the largest substring. So now, we replace it with `1+max(lcs("<empty>", "<empty>"), lcs("<empty>", "<empty>"))`. Those are all base cases, so all the empty cases return `0`. The right half follows in a similar problem.

#### The Base Case

* If any of the substrings are empty, we can't have anything in common, so it's zero.&#x20;

### Dynamic Programming Sub-Problem Decomposition

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/dynamic-programming-sub-problem-subsequence-decomposition.jpeg)

#### Bottom-Up Solution

```java
class Solution {
  public int longestCommonSubsequenceLength(String s1, String s2) {
    /*
     * s2 will be on the rows, s1 will be on the columns.
     * 
     * +1 to leave room at the left for the "".
     */
    int cache[][] = new int[s2.length() + 1][s1.length() + 1];

    /*
     * cache[s2.length()][s1.length()] is our original subproblem. Each entry in the
     * table is taking a substring operation against whatever string is on the rows
     * or columns.
     * 
     * It goes from index 0 to index s2Row/s1Col (exclusive)
     * 
     * So if my s1 = "azb" and s1Col = 2...then my substring that I pass to the
     * lcs() function will be:
     * 
     * 0 1 2 "a  z  b"
     * 
     * "az" (index 2...our upper bound of the snippet...is excluded)
     */
    for (int s2Row = 0; s2Row <= s2.length(); s2Row++) {
      for (int s1Col = 0; s1Col <= s1.length(); s1Col++) {
        if (s2Row == 0 || s1Col == 0) {
          cache[s2Row][s1Col] = 0;
        } else if (s2.charAt(s2Row - 1) == s1.charAt(s1Col - 1)) {
          cache[s2Row][s1Col] = cache[s2Row - 1][s1Col - 1] + 1;
        } else {
          cache[s2Row][s1Col] = Math.max(
            cache[s2Row - 1][s1Col], cache[s2Row][s1Col - 1]
          );
        }
      }
    }

    return cache[s2.length()][s1.length()];
  }
}
```

#### Complexity

* n=s1.len
* m=s2.len
* **Time: `O(mn)`**
* **Space: `O(mn)`**

Obviously, this is way better than brute force.

## Maximum Subarray Problem

### Divide and Conquer Methodology

Recall the [maximum subarray problem](../divide-and-conquer/lecture-05-divide-and-conquer-analysis.md#maximum-contiguous-subarray-problem) from lecture 05:

* Goal: find the largest sum within the entire array. Like a stock market, after what day should we have sold the stock?
* Solve it using divide/conquer by splitting arrays into half, calculating individual sums and merging them... somehow. I forgot.
* The running time is: `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)`.
  * `2`: Left and right half.
  * `n/2` because it's just half of the array.
  * `O(n)` because we have to check all the numbers when merging it together.
* By the master theorem: `T(n) = O(n*log(n))`

### Dynamic Approach Solution

> * Items in a subarray must be consecutive.
> * If adding nums\[i] to s\[i-1] is not bigger than nums\[i] itself, simply let's have a new subarray starting with nums\[i].

Below is the dynamic approach solution:

> ```java
> int[] s = new int[nums.length];
> s[0] = nums[0]; //s[i]: sum of items in a subarray of nums[0,i]
> int max = nums[0]; //Keep track of the maximum sum.
>
> for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
>     s[i] = Math.max(nums[i], s[i-1] + nums[i]);
>     if (s[i] > max)
>         max = s[i];
> }
> return max
> ```
>
> _Source: Dr. Yao's Notes_

* The run time is now `O(n)` instead of `O(n * log(n))`
