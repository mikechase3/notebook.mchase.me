# Large Language Models Jargon Free Explanation

## Chat Gippity

* GPT4 was released to the public around April 2023 and it performed very well such that it increased peoples' productivity.&#x20;
* In any emails or papers where formality matters, I have to outline what I want to say into topic paragraphs, body paragraphs, and a closing sentence when working with customers.&#x20;
* With Chat GPT, I can just be like `Write an email to the employee explaining that he can't bring his device to the network because it only uses WPA2 and our devices must be WPA3 because it's more secure even though in practice it's just as secure as WPA2 for now. We're future proofing it and don't want your cheap chineese smart lights on our network.`&#x20;
* Then I can essentially perform math on my languages like "add some professional language" and it knows what to do with that.
* **Topic Reveal**: How does that black magic work?
* **Credibility**: I'm a software engineer at USAF Gaming Research Integration for Learning Lab & we try and understand these technologies so we can modify and use these consumer off-the-shelf technologies out in the field.
* **Thesis**: Today, I'm going to step away from the conventional programming via step-by-step instructions and discuss something completely different: how Chat GPT predicts text.
* **Preview**:&#x20;
  * First, we're going to talk about how we can add/subtract terms to sentences and how that's mathematically represented as a vector.
  * Then, the transformer.&#x20;
  * Finally, how they're trained and why it requires a phenomenally large quantity of data.





GPT4 came out and did something special: make it publicly available. It's rare that people make things publicly available these days, but the platform was refreshing.&#x20;
