# Divide and Conquer Technique

## General Technique

1. **Divide** the problem into sub-problems.
2. **Conquer** sub-problems by _recursively_ solving them.
3. Solve the **base case** when problems are small enough to solve by brute force.
4. **Combine** solutions to sub-problems to build a solution to the original problem.

In more detail:

> 1. **Divide** and break up the problem into the smallest possible “subproblem”, of the exact same type.
> 2. **Conquer** and tackle the smallest subproblems first. Once you’ve figured out a solution that works, use that exact same technique to solve the larger subproblems — in other words, solve the subproblems recursively.
> 3. **Combine** the answers and build up the smaller subproblems until you finally end up applying the same solution to the larger, more complicated problem that you started off with!

Example:

In sorting algorithms, sometimes we divide arrays into smaller arrays so we can solve each small part by brute force and put them together.
