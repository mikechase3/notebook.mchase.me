* &#x20;Every possible wave form can be made by adding a bunch of sine waves (infinitely).
* Non repeating waveforms can be generated by adding sine waves together, but in these cases sine waves of every possible frequency may be needed.
* **Frequency spectrum**: when we take a derivative of stuff, we get this.

### Use Cases

* To improve the quality like make sound transformations, we make transformations upon that signal.
* First, we have to convert the signal into a **digital format**.
* We'll **sample** it into a digital format.&#x20;

## Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem

If a function x(t) contains no frequencies higher than B cps (cycles per second / Hertz), it is completely determined by giving its ordinates at a series of points spaced < 1/2B seconds apart.

**Aliasing**: happens when we under-sample our original signal. Later, when we try to obtain our original signal, we'll have a lower frequency that's totally different. I think aliasing is when the rate of the thing capturing the frequency isn't high enough to see the frequency of rotation. It's like how car tires look like they're going backwards when moving fast enough.&#x20;

Nyquist says we should sample at least twice the rate of the original signal. The higher the sampling rate, the better the digitized data will be.&#x20;

## Application: JPEG Images

* We can compress it using the FFT algorithm
* The more we compress, the more data we'll lose.&#x20;
* The thrown-out parts are stuff we wouldn't notice equally.

### Color Space Conversion

* Instead of storing RGB separately in different channels, we use something called **chroma subsampling.**

### Discrete Cosine Transform

We can 'characterize' the frequency components and then say that those pixels will be of our 'sample'.' Basically repeating what an 8x8 grid looks like and storing it in less bits.

### Run Length & Huffman Encoding

Reduces the number of bits & is lossless.

### History

* **Gauss**: analyzed periodic motion of asteroid Ceres
* **Runge-Konig (1924)**: Laid theoretical gorundwork
* **Danielson-Lanczos (1942)**: Efficient algorithm, x-ray crystallography
* **Cooley-Turkey (1965)**: monitoring nuclear tests in Soviet Union and tracking submarines. Rediscovered & popularized FFT.
* Importance is not fully realized until the advent of digital computers.

### Misc

* Random: Use vector graphics for simple things like logos because it's lossless and can be scaled. PNG is better for sharp edges.
* Optics, digital media, etc.&#x20;

## Polynomials & FFS

### Representations of Polynomials

* Currently, multiply (convolve) is expensive with the brute force approach and takes O(n^2) time.

### Horner's Method

### Factoring Polynomials

* The **degree** is the highest `x`.
* $$A(x): (x_0, y_0), ..., (x_{n-1}, y_{n-1})$$

There's a lot more here I didn't really get & need to review hard with Bard or something.

### Converting Between Polynomial Representations

| Representation | Multiply | Evaluate |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Coefficient    | O(n^2)   | O(n)     |
| Point Value    | O(n)     | ?        |

### Fast Fourier Transform

How do we convert coefficient form to point value? That's the goal of this.

1. **Divide:** break the polynomial up into even and odd powers.
2. **Intuition:** choose two points to be +-1.

#### The "Fun Part"

* The cost is the same with A(x)=A\_even(x^2)+x(A\_odd x^2)
* We don't have to re-execute because we have a value obtained in some operation.&#x20;
* Just **multiply** things by **-x**.

### Discrete Fourier Transform

* **Key idea:** Choose $$x_k=\omega \texttt{TODO FIND THIS!}$$
* **Roots of Unity**: a complex number `x` such that x^n=1
  * Explained by Euler's Identity.
