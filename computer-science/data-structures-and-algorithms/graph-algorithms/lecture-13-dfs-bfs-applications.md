# Weighted Graphs (L13)

## Weighted Digraphs

* In [lecture 12](lecture-12-graph-fundamentals.md), we used directed graphs and showed that we store all the node objects as integers.
* Adjacency lists store outgoing nodes we point to in the Adjacency list.&#x20;

When it comes to directed **weighted** graphs; however, we also have to specify the weight. In the example below, we'll store the **weights** as doubles as a new parameter in our adjacency list.

### Weighted Digraph Implementation

```java
public class DirectedEdge{ //Define a class for the edge.

    //Class Variables. Edges are only declared once.
    private final int v, w;
    private final double weight;
    
    //Constructor to make the directed edge.
    public DirectedEdge(int v, int w, double weight){
        this.v = v;
        this.w = w;
        this.weight = weight;
    }
    
    // Member Methods; (v is source, w is destination).
    
    //Find the source node.
    public int from(){ //endpoint v of edge v->w
        return v;
    }
    
    //Find the destination node.
    public int to(){ //Endpoint v -> w
        return w;
    }
    
    public double weight(){
        return weight;
    }
}
```

### Importing Graph Nodes & Edges

Breadth First Search is covered just a bit in lecture 13, but is primarily discussed in lecture 14 so I put it there.&#x20;
