## Applications of Graph Traversal Algorithms

1. Friendster: who are your best friends & recommendations
2. Maze traversal
3. Fewest number of hops in a communication network.

## Breadth First Search

* `L` is a layer. We create
* **Theroem:** for each i, L\_i,&#x20;

### Flood Fill

Given a lime green pixel in an image, change the color of an entire blob.&#x20;

We'll look at all ajacent pixels, but the system knows that when you draw connected components all the pixels are blah blah blah we're over time.
