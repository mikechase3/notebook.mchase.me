# Directed Graphs (3.5/3.6)

* These are juts like graphs, but you have to pay attention to their directions.
* Edge (u,v) goes from u-> v one way (e.g. hyperlinks)
* **Applications**: directed reachability (find all nodes reachable from `s`; directed shortest path problem; web crawlers.

## Strong Connectivity

* Everything is mutually reachable.&#x20;
