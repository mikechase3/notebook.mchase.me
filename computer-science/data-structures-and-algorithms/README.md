# Data Structures, Algorithms, Analysis

This is a collection of notes Mike Chase has prepared for Dr. Zhongmei Yao's CPS 350/450/530 classes.

## Purpose

1. Specifically help other UD students remember what we learned in this class.
2. Present future students with a glimpse at what they'll be learning in this class.
3. Remember what I learned in this class.
4. Find and provide resources for others taking this, specific class.
5. Make Mike Chase's future interviewing life easier.
6. I don't know please work Gitfox.
