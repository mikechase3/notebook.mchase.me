# History of Algorithms

* **Algorithm**: a step-by-step instruction set.

## Alan Turing

* We focus on techniques for efficient computation in terms of time and space.

## Efficient Examples

* You can swap two numbers without using a `temp` variable by subtracting one number & adding the opposite or something.
* **Recursive Doubling**: ((2^2)^2)^2 is more efficient than `2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2`.&#x20;

## Design Considerations

* **Proof of Correctness**: using mathematical induction, contradiction, loop invariants
* **Theory:** complexity classes, lower bounds, reduction
* **Practice**: overcome intractability via approximation & improve performance through randomization.
