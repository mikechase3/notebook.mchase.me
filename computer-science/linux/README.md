# Linux

## Course Description

CPS 4\[5\]44 \(3 hours\) prepares students for developing software in the UNIX/Linux environment using the C and Go programming languages. Topics include libraries and system calls, shells, system structures and internals, interprocess communication \(pipes and signals\), communicating sequential processes, network programming \(client-server model and sockets\), configuration and compilation management, pattern matching and filters, shell programming, automatic program generation, and GUI programming. Students can also expect a survey of various software tools supporting systems programming, including gcc, gdb, make, git, sed and awk, and lex and yacc. The course does not aim to be comprehensive, but rather focuses on thematic issues. Assignments are designed to provide students with a pragmatic exposure to these tools as well as issues faced by modern practitioners. CPS \[45\]44 is a programming-intensive course.
