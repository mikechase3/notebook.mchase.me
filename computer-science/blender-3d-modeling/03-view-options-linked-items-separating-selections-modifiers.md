# 03: View Options, Linked Items, Separating, Selections, Modifiers

## View Options

![The wire-frame/flat circle button](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (657).png>)

If you need to select throughout an entire object, and not just the surface, change your viewing mode using one of these buttons (on the right) to change it into a wire-frame.

## Separating Selection

`Mesh => Separate => Selection`  lets you create new objects in the hierarchy.. When I duplicated the doughnut and make the ice cream

## Linked Items

Lets say you didn't separate the selection immediately. If you need to do that after the fact, you can go back into editing mode, select a vertex, and search for `linked` in the command pallet.

## Solidify Modifier

* Make something solid by going to `modifiers`  and add a component called `Solidify`.&#x20;
* You might have to make an offset.

## Ordering Modifiers

* The ordering of modifiers matters.
* For example, subdividing before solidifying will make the rendering take longer.
* We can reverse the order to make rendering more efficient.
