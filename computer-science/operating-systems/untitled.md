# Processes & Process Management

## Processes in Memory

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (152).png>)

* An operating system executes a variety of programs
  * Batch systems: **jobs**.
  * Timer-shared systems: **user programs** or **tasks**.&#x20;
* The textbook uses the terms job and process almost interchangeably.
* **Process**: a program in its execution.
  * Current activity, including the _program counter_, processor registers.
    * A program counter is like a line-by-line examination.
    * A pointer to the current line of execution.
    * Processor registers: temporary holding spaces for data. Smallest, but fastest.
  * Stack: contains temporary data.
    * Function parameters, return addresses, local variables.
    * In operating systems, it specifies a region in the hardware.
  * Data Section: contains global regions?

| Process    | Comment                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| new        | The process is being created.                                                                                                                                  |
| running    | Instructions are being executed. The CPU scheduler takes a process from the head of the ready queue to execute. Sometimes, there may be multiple ready queues. |
| Waiting    | The process is waiting for another event to occur.                                                                                                             |
| Ready      | The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor                                                                                                           |
| Terminated | The process has finished execution.                                                                                                                            |
