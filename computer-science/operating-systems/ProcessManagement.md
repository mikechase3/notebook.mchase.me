# Processes & Process Management
* From second lecture during grad school. Search my PC for `1.2 Process and Process Management` to see the lecture.
* **Processes** are in execution while **applications** are programs on disks not being executed.

## Process Execution State
### What is a processed composed of?
* *See also: what's in a `.exe` file* [investigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ojciptvVtY)

Processes are an abstraction of several components:
1. **Text/Data** have some text, machine code, and other static info like metadata when the file is loaded.
2. **Heap**: during execution, the processes dynamically creates stuff in memory before calculating results.
3. **Stack**: this is a dynamic part of the address space growing/shrinking. Always last-in-first-out.

Processes see **virtual addresses** when running. 
Anything requiring memory generated by processes is stored in the **address space**.
Operating systems use **page tables** to map virtual addresses to physical ones.

### How do Operating Systems Manage Processes?
* **Program Counters**: count the cycles & tells the OS which lines to pause/interrupt/restore from & to.
* The program counter is maintained in a register on the CPU. There are other **CPU Registers**
* **Stack Pointers** tell us where the top of the stack is containing info about the last item.
* **Process Control Blocks** contain all the information about status/execution. 

### What is a process control block (PCB) composed of?
All the above information about the status of information is contained in a PCB block. Together, it consists of the:
1. Process state: 
2. Process number: 
3. Program counter: 
4. Registers (the contents in CPU): 
5. Memory limits: 
6. List of open files: 
7. Priority: 
8. Signal Mask: 
9. CPU Scheduling Info:

### How do we Use Process Control Blocks? 
* We discussed this in a high-level. 
* When context switching, the CPU saves the state to a PCB block and restores other.
* When more memory is needed, we perform a **Mallotcall**

### What is Context Switching?
Context switching when you swap between processes. 
It is **expensive** because it takes lots of cycles to load & store all the values of the PCB to/from mem

## Process Lifecycle
### What is the lifecycle of a process. (List the "states" it goes through")
1. **New:** Initially, a process enters the "new" state where the OS performs admission control & determine whether
to block or allow a process to run based on policy & available resources.
2. **Ready**: process is admitted & ready to start executing. It's on-hold for the scheduler to move it to a running state.
3. **Running**: after the **scheduler dispatch**, it'll run and be in (`interrupt` || `I/O or event wait` | ) 
4. **Terminated**: it'll exit peacefully and return a result.

This is a redundant visual of what I said above but more complicated:
Event waits are usually caused by hard drives and i/o devices.

|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| new        | The process is being created.                                                                                                                                  |
| running    | Instructions are being executed. The CPU scheduler takes a process from the head of the ready queue to execute. Sometimes, there may be multiple ready queues. |
| Waiting    | The process is waiting for another event to occur.                                                                                                             |
| Ready      | The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor                                                                                                           |
| Terminated | The process has finished execution.                                                                                                                            |

### What are the two commonly used mechanisms for creating a process?
* **[FORK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9seb8hddeK4&t=0s)** copies the parent PCB onto a new PCB and child continues execution at the fork.
* **[EXEC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj2VjcOXXs4&t=0s)**: will replace the child imap. It loads new a new program starting from the first instruction.
* Here's an optional [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l64ySYHmMmY) showing off how these work.



#### Misc
* Once the inital boot process is done and the OS is loaded, it'll create some initial process. 
  * "It can be represented as a tree". That seemed important.
  * Then more procesess spawn as a user logs in & he starts programs.



## Processes in Memory

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (152).png>)

* An operating system executes a variety of programs
  * Batch systems: **jobs**.
  * Timer-shared systems: **user programs** or **tasks**.&#x20;
* The textbook uses the terms job and process almost interchangeably.
* **Process**: a program in its execution.
  * Current activity, including the _program counter_, processor registers.
    * A program counter is like a line-by-line examination.
    * A pointer to the current line of execution.
    * Processor registers: temporary holding spaces for data. Smallest, but fastest.
  * Stack: contains temporary data.
    * Function parameters, return addresses, local variables.
    * In operating systems, it specifies a region in the hardware.
  * Data Section: contains global regions?
