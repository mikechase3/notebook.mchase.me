# Processes & Process Management
* From second lecture during grad school. Search my PC for `1.2 Process and Process Management` to see the lecture.
* **Processes** are in execution while **applications** are programs on disks not being executed.

## Process Execution State
### What is a processed composed of?
* *See also: what's in a `.exe` file* [investigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ojciptvVtY)

Processes are an abstraction of several components:
1. **Text/Data** have some text, machine code, and other static info like metadata when the file is loaded.
2. **Heap**: during execution, the processes dynamically creates stuff in memory before calculating results.
3. **Stack**: this is a dynamic part of the address space growing/shrinking. Always last-in-first-out.

Processes see **virtual addresses** when running. 
Anything requiring memory generated by processes is stored in the **address space**.
Operating systems use **page tables** to map virtual addresses to physical ones.

### How do Operating Systems Manage Processes?
* **Program Counters**: count the cycles & tells the OS which lines to pause/interrupt/restore from & to.
* The program counter is maintained in a register on the CPU. There are other **CPU Registers**
* **Stack Pointers** tell us where the top of the stack is containing info about the last item.
* **Process Control Blocks** contain all the information about status/execution. 

### What is a process control block (PCB) composed of?
All the above information about the status of information is contained in a PCB block. Together, it consists of the:
1. Process state: 
2. Process number: 
3. Program counter: 
4. Registers (the contents in CPU): 
5. Memory limits: 
6. List of open files: 
7. Priority: 
8. Signal Mask: 
9. CPU Scheduling Info:

## Processes in Memory

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (152).png>)

* An operating system executes a variety of programs
  * Batch systems: **jobs**.
  * Timer-shared systems: **user programs** or **tasks**.&#x20;
* The textbook uses the terms job and process almost interchangeably.
* **Process**: a program in its execution.
  * Current activity, including the _program counter_, processor registers.
    * A program counter is like a line-by-line examination.
    * A pointer to the current line of execution.
    * Processor registers: temporary holding spaces for data. Smallest, but fastest.
  * Stack: contains temporary data.
    * Function parameters, return addresses, local variables.
    * In operating systems, it specifies a region in the hardware.
  * Data Section: contains global regions?

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| new        | The process is being created.                                                                                                                                  |
| running    | Instructions are being executed. The CPU scheduler takes a process from the head of the ready queue to execute. Sometimes, there may be multiple ready queues. |
| Waiting    | The process is waiting for another event to occur.                                                                                                             |
| Ready      | The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor                                                                                                           |
| Terminated | The process has finished execution.                                                                                                                            |
