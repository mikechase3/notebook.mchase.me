# Operating Systems

## Sources of Information

### CPS 356 Undergraduate Course Content

1. I took notes on [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/view/cps356/home).
2. I took notes within PDFs
   in: `MikeChase\000-025 Educational Years\018-022 College University of Dayton\16th Grade\Academics\CPS 356 Operating Systems`
3. Video lectures are available.

### CPS 536 Graduate Course Content
Ranked in order of usefulness:
1. MindMap has details from lectures 09-onwards.
2. Physical flashcards have details for lecture before W09 (the first midterm).
3. Lecture videos are stashed in `MikeChase\000-025\2023\Career\Education\CPS 536 Operating Systems Fall23`
4. Made a [quizlet deck](https://quizlet.com/mikechase3/folders/ud-cps536f23-operating-systems?i=ss8s&x=1xqt)
5. Remnants are in OneNote, but probably nothing useful & I hardly used it.
