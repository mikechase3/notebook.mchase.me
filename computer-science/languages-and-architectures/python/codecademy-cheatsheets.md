# Codecademy Cheatsheets

Below contains links to really valuable resources that I don't own \(so I can't put them here... sadly.

| Title | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Computer Science](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science) | Entire list, paid content.  |
| [Python Syntax](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science/tracks/cspath-intro/modules/cspath-python-syntax/cheatsheet) | Python 3 \| Nice syntax overview. |
