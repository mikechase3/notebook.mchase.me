# .NET Ecosystem (C#, F#, VB)

* .NET is "your platform for building anything"  from IOT, Web, Mobile, AI, etc.
* A few languages are used and there are tons of runtimes/environments everywhere.
* It's Microsoft Java. Build once, run almost everywhere.
* Desktop apps, mobile ,raspberry pi, Unity, etc.

## How to run .NET

There was a bunch of different ways to run .NET for a while:

* .NET Framework (runs on Windows)
* **.NET Core (new & open-source) and Runs Everywhere.**
* Mono/Xamarin for linux (a open source reimplementation on .net that originally ran on Linux).

## Running from CLI

Once you're in the directory, run a `.cs` file using the syntax: `dotnet run whateverProgram.cs`.

This is all being combined into a .NET SDK with one base class library (BCL).
