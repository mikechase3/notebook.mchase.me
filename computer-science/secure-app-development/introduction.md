#### **Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:**

* design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
* recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
* have knowledge of principles and practices for secure computing.

## Application Development

* We're focusing on web-apps. 
* Some sort-of application with some sort-of functionality.
* Normally, developers focus on the functionalities of the application.
* We'll work in teams of 2 people.
* Classmates: Asia, Luis F, Devin P, Anna, Samantha C

## Focus: 

* We're going to be developing applications.

## Attacks

* Cross-Site Attacks
* SQL 
* Buffer-overflow attacks _use input-validation_.

## New Development

* Previously, a security team would test and improve an application.
* Nowawadays, the developer is responsible for security, called the _Secure Development Life Cycle_
