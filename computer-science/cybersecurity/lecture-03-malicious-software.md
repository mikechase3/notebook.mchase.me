# Lecture 03: Malicious Software

## Malware

### Classifications

Malware is classified into a couple of broad categories.

1. How it spreads/propagates
2. The actions or payloads it performs when the target is reached.
3. Those needing a host program \(viruses & parasitic code\)
4. Those that are independent, self-contained programs like worms, trojans, and bots.
5. Malware that doesn't replicate \(trojans and spam emails\)
6. Malware that doesn't replicate \(like viruses and worms\).

### Propagation Mechanisms

1. **Injection** of existing content by viruses spead to other systems
2. **Exploit** of software vulnerabilities by worms or drive-by-downloads
3. **Social Engineering**

### **Payload Actions**

Payload actions are performed by malware once it reaches a target.

* Corruption of system/data files
* Theft of service/make the system a zombie agent of an attack as part of the botnet.
* Theft of information from the system like keylogging.
* Stealthing/hiding its presence on the system.

## Attack Kits

* Initially the development and deployment of malware required considerable technical skills by software.
  * The development of virus-creation toolkits in the early 1990s and then more general attack kits in the 200s greatly assisted in the development/deployment of malware.
