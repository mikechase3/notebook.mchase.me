# Lecture 03: Malicious Software

## 6.1: Types of Malicious Software \(Malware\)

### Classifications

Malware is classified into a couple of broad categories.

1. How it spreads/propagates
2. The actions or payloads it performs when the target is reached.
3. Those needing a host program \(viruses & parasitic code\)
4. Those that are independent, self-contained programs like worms, trojans, and bots.
5. Malware that doesn't replicate \(trojans and spam emails\)
6. Malware that doesn't replicate \(like viruses and worms\).

### Propagation Mechanisms

1. **Injection** of existing content by viruses spead to other systems
2. **Exploit** of software vulnerabilities by worms or drive-by-downloads
3. **Social Engineering**

### **Payload Actions**

Payload actions are performed by malware once it reaches a target.

* Corruption of system/data files
* Theft of service/make the system a zombie agent of an attack as part of the botnet.
* Theft of information from the system like keylogging.
* Stealthing/hiding its presence on the system.

### Attack Kits

* Initially the development and deployment of malware required considerable technical skills by software.
  * The development of virus-creation toolkits in the early 1990s and then more general attack kits in the 200s greatly assisted in the development/deployment of malware.
* Toolkits are often known as 'crimeware'
  * They include a variety of propagation mechanisms and payload modules that even novices can deploy
  * Variants that can be generated by attackers using these toolkits creates a significant problem for those defending systems against them.

#### Widely Used Toolkits

* Zeus
* Blackhole
* Sakura
* Phoenix

### Attack Sources

There are a lot of different reasons why people attack systems.

* Politically motivated attackers
* Criminals
* Organized Crime
* Organizations that sell their services
* Politically motivated

## 6.2: Advanced Persistent Threats \(APTs\)

### Definition

* Well resourced, persistent application of a wide variety of intrusion technologies and malware to selected targets \(usually business/political\).
* Typically attributed to state-sponsored organizations and criminal enterprises.
* They differ from other types of attack by their careful target selection and stealthy intrusion efforts over extended periods.
* **Examples:** High-profile attacks include Aurora, RSA, APT1, and Stuxnet.

### APT Characteristics

### APT Attacks

* **AIM**: Disrupt infrastructure and make it look unnoticeable.
* **Techniques Used**: Social engineering, spear-phishing email, drive-by-downloads from compressed websites likely to be visited by personnel in the target organization.
* **Intent**: Infect the target with sophisticated malware with multiple propagation mechanisms/payloads.

## 6.3: Viruses

Viruses goes through its propagation and tries to spread to any number of other programs it setup its propagation method to.

### Viruses Components

| Term | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Infection Mechanism | How it spreads |
| Trigger | Event that determines how it gets activated \(are we on a centrifuge?\) |
| Payload | What the virus actually does \(ie slow centrifuge\) |

### Virus Phases

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Dormant Phase | It's there, but it's waiting for the triggering conditions to be true before its activated. |
| Triggering Phase | The virus is activated in some way that the virus is able to observe it. |
| Propagation Phase | The virus will copy itself. |
| Execution | The function is executed. |

### Virus Structure

#### More on Compression Virus

One of the mechanisms anti-virus does is check the file size of executables. If the executable's size is increased, it's very easy to observe and stop. Therefore, prepending the simple virus will make that executable be caught.

A compression virus inserts itself such that the virus size doesn't change.
