# Chapter 01: Cyber Security Fundamentals

## What is Cyberspace

* **Burning Chrome**: The term was coined in a SciFi story.

## Course Objectives

* Introduct/understand theory of cyber security
* Provide practical experience in hardening a system to achieve resilience against cyber attacks.

#### Confidentiality

* Keep data/resources hidden.
* Need-to-know basis
* Protect system configuration and network topology info.

#### Integrity

* Protect data against unauthorized changes.
* Origin integrity (authentication)
* Mechanisms fall into prevention or detention.

#### Availability

* Staff and customers can use the data and resources.
* Defend against DoS attacks.

## Security Challenges

1. The developer needs to identify all weaknesses.
2. The procedures used to provide particular services are often counterintuitive.
3. Users and system managers don't value security until a failure occurs.
4. Security requires constant monitoring.
5. Security impedes efficiency/user friendliness.

## Vulnerabilities, Threats, & Attacks Overview

* **Vulnerabilities**: System weaknesses (corruptions, leakiness, unavailability of services)
* **Threats**: capable of exploiting vulnerabilities and represent potential harms to assets.
* **Attacks**/Exploits: Altering system resources, alter system resources, insider threats.

### Classes of Threats

Threats are potential violations of security.

* Disclosure: unauthorized access like snooping or exfiltration
* Deception: acceptance of false data
* Deception: modification, spoofing, repudation of origin/denial of receipt.
* Disruption: Interruption of correct operation
* Usurpation: unauthorized control/modification/spoofing/DoS

### Countermeasures

* **Prevention:** prevent attackers from violating security policy and employ mechanisms users can't override.
* **Detection**: detect a violation of security policy. This also indicates the effectiveness of prevention mechanisms.
* **Recovery**: Stop the attack or continue to function correctly even if attack succeeds. This is difficult to implement and only used in safety-critical systems.

### Examples of Threats

### Passive and Active Attacks

* **Passive attacks**: attempt to learn information about systems without affecting them. The goal is to obtain information being transmitted.
* **Active attacks:** attempt to alter system resources and affect operation.
  * Replay
  * Masquerade
  * Modification of messages
  * Denial of Service
