Name Slide

* Go over the main parts of our projects

## Vinay Kamisetty & Mansa Kakumani

### **Sea Dragon**

* Assets: mountains, terrain, different dragons, fire breathing, food.
* **Landscape:** mountains, a lake & canal, and a sunset.
* **Arena**: pillars, caves, rocks, etc. Issue was that they initially had small water?
* Synchronization failures between dragons were the biggest challenge. One dragon was out of the frame so they played with one dragon?&#x20;
  * Looks like their keyboard controls were mapped to both dragons.
* Flowers/Rocks: they initially wanted a flower path but had issues.
* Once the dragon ate 10 apples, it 'wins'. They showed the sea dragon dance in their video demo.
* Background music. Particle physics with fire.&#x20;
* Dragon fights: it swtiches an animation.&#x20;

Summary: it seems like they boasted about the assets they had. Music made it seem cooler too. The **Main Drawbacks** was time management and it took too much time.&#x20;

### Roller Coaster

* Assets: lightning, had a track.
* Implementation: unity env, roller coaster.
* **Issues:** applying physics, sound effects w/ the trigger box?

### AR Project

* They used King Napoleon.&#x20;
* **Packages:** AR Core; AR Foundation; Vuforia. Replaced the main camera with an AR Camera?&#x20;
* **After Effects**: put sound in the image? It's a video & tried animating it? Some mild movement.

## Team2

### Sea Dragon

* **Challenges**: synchronization failures between dragons was hardest, but they didn't describe why or how to let us guess.

### Roller Coaster

* Sample images for the deserts.
* **Issues**: physics didn't work. Waterfall wasn't realistic.

### AR Implementation

* They did the death of Socrates.
* Modified the painting. Took layers out through Adobe Photoshop. Converted it into a bit more 3D?&#x20;
* After Effects added 3D motion. Added audio too into the image/video?&#x20;
* Vuforia implementation: installs packages. AR Foundation & AR Core are important.

## Abhinav Reddy Chimmula

* **Sea Dragon:** Used Photon to add multiplayer.&#x20;
* **Roller Coaster:** a splash sould occur when triggering with water.
* **AR Project:** solar system? Spinning. You were supposed to do it on a painting & animate it but he showed a solar system with no AR.

## Team 4

* **Sea Dragon**: had a 2x2 grid where dragons collected apples. Nothing thrilling.
* **Roller Coaster**: scary/holloween themed. Particle system. Rain. Lightning. Ghost Track white outline that looks cool. Was no splashing; less realistic.
* **XR/AR:** imported SDK and google cardboard XR plugin. Switched to Android and canged settings like APK level, resolution, changes in graddle templates? Built and ran the project on Android. When we tried splitting the screen there was some graphics issues.&#x20;
* **AR Project**: downloaded vuforia, applied license. Made a 3D world and put target image on a 2D plane. Took the character girl witht he pearl earring and couldn't get lips to sync. Blender wasn't working well so they didn't have time to really make stuff well due to time constraints too. Made a nice doll box/painting and snow falling particle animation system.&#x20;

## Cherish Teja Vijjagiri & ?

### Sea Dragon

Much better communication & a conversational. The liked how they learned Photon and some basic multiplayer. The main issue was the wrong approach. They wish they would've impelmented photon first & build the world around it. PUN callbacks to see if things are working was something they learned. Animator controller was made from scratch. We can get in-touch with obstacles, drop around. They had some nice powerpoint affects. They are "keen on small details" which is a great adjective for students when English isn't their first language; I loved it! They also had four different terrains & overall the teerrain looked well. Their issue was to create an animation layout. Instead, they used a **BLEND TREE** which made it easier & more managable.&#x20;

They presented their challenges very well. E.g. `Challenge: to mimic natural eating`. So now they're talking about how it's implemented. They didn't mention trigger boxes specifically but implied when the dragon collided with it (in a small radius), it'll get eaten.

Photon was imported. They created a room first. There's a master/slave client.&#x20;

### Roller Coaster

* **Prefab** was mentioend for the track & car.&#x20;
* It was deployed on Android. Split screen was pretty smooth. Moving to android was easy and they had libraries within Unity.

### AR Project

They used _**Leiapix**_ tool to create a depth effect. It's available online & made the job easy taking about ten minutes. They wanted to make it look 3D and interactive. They added water that would shake and put the water on a water plane. Took the particles splashing from the roller coaster. Discussed how one project helped another one.

### What They Learned

* Building games from scratch was hard. Building the most s\*\*\*\*\* game is even an accomplishment.&#x20;
* Deploying games on different platforms was something people used which was cool.
* Coding in C#
* Implementing VR Enabled experiences in games
* Implement multiplayer services using hoton.
