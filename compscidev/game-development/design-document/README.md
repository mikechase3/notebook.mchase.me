## Benefits

* Game Design Document GDD: a game design document puts everyone on the same page.
* Ensures you/team have a plan for game production
* **Feedback**: people can give some early in the development process before too many are invested.
* **Downfall**: not agile, you must update the living documents.

## Coin Dash - Introduction Components

* **Introduction**: a brief intro to the project itself. It should contain a clear vision statement outlining the high-level pitch for the game and what makes it special.
* **Vision Statement:** convey what the game will be, why it'll be interesting/fun, why and how will it be unique?
* **Log line:** a brief summary of a story that captures the essence of the plot in one or two sentences.
  * A little fox dude, named foxy, is running around trying to hustle to get a PS5, so you need to get as many coins as possible.
  * Be creative. Give the player some motivation.
  * Maybe instead of just beig a fox, you'll become a crab.&#x20;
* **Gameplay synopsis:** a couple of paragraphs about the core gameplay loops and overall structure.
  * Your different animals are collecting shynies and your player gets to become an honorary niffiler (from Harry Potter).

## Goals

* This section defines the player experience goals - focusing on what you as the dev want players to feel while playing the game.
* Do you want the player to feel challenged intellectually?
* Do you want the player to feel relaxed & happy in a cozy environment?
* Do you want the player to feel a sense of progression as their character navigates increasingly diffcult situations?

The goal ssection isn't limited to player experience & can include sales goals, target demographics, reception as an expression of ideas, etc.&#x20;

## Game World

This section speaks to the overall world of the game, and high-level notes on how players will progress through it or experience it.

* How is your world divided into sections?
* Are there any discrete levels?
* An overworld? _A map? Everyone loves maps._
* Some means of traversal? _do we have a horse? Do we have to walk there?_

### Tips

* Pictures are better. If you have physical areas a rough map can be useful.
* Provide reference art when possible.
* Artwork doesn't need to be a finished product, but convdey:
  * Core geographical features
  * Architectual elements
  * Time period or style.

## Mechanics

* Mechanics are the ways player interact iwth the world and systems of the game, and the way those systems give feedback or react to the player's actions.
* Use player **verbs** and the ways the game responds to them.

### Examples of Game Mechanics

* **Platformers**: running & jumping
* **Shootrers:** traversing terrain and shooting enemies.
* **RPG:** character creation, skill development/leveling.

## Characters

* This section contains information about the games protagonist and antagonist
* A character web that shows character's relationships can be helpful to explain cahracters and interpersonal dynamics.
* Web: some relationships with webs. If you're old DK, you can probably defeat him. he's related to bigger/tougher DK.
* List of enemies: list them all. What's their movement?

## Story

If your game has a story, this section contains the narrative elements of your game.

* This is perhaps the most variable section of the GDD.
* If your game is narrative heavy, it could link to outlines, interactive story documents, scripts, or other resources.
* This is largely based on the type of game you plan on creating. RPGs and visual novels are often defined by their story.

## UI

* This section defines the control scheme of your game and details the interface elements (menus, HUD options, on-screen text) that is required for the game.
* Oftentimes, a simple example of the menu screen, intro screen, HUD during gameplay, and ending screen are enough.
* This section should ideally list all of the media asssets you'll need for the UI: menu icons, animations, etc.&#x20;

## Audio

* If your game features audio, then this section can include high-level notes on sound design or musical needs.
* This section can also list the media assets you will expect to utilize: sound effects, unique level music, etc.
* Sound FX, ambient music, collisions with obstacles.&#x20;
