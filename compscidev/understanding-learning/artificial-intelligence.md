# Artificial Intelligence

## Computer Intelligence Basics

### Knowledge Engineering

1. Feed a computer human knowledge.
   1. Objects versus situations.
   2. Cause an effect.
2. Develop software programs that
   1. Analyze data
   2. Reach the same conclusions humans do.

### The Modeling Process

Goal: Keep refining algorithms until they're consistent with what a human will do.

1. Data
2. Processing algorithms.
3. Predict future outcomes.
4. Make decisions about the next steps.
5. Produce results & evaluate them. Store them in the pool of data.

### Importance

* Product enhancements and features
* New user experiences in new markets
  * Chat bots
  * Identifying fraud.
  * Security features like fingerprints.
  * Payroll & Auditing
  * Moderating social media content.
  * Alexa voice recognition & suggestions.
* Make predictions
* Optimize utility functions
* Extract hidden data structures
* Classify data.
* Predict the future.

### Machine Learning

* You can give a computer images of what people look like.
* The machine can **learn** and become more confident when it comes to new challenges like facial hair or people with different color skin.
* More information in

### Deep Learning

> Deep Learning takes Machine Learning a step further. Rather than telling the machine what features it needs to look for, Deep Learning enables the machine to define the features it needs to look for itself based on the data it's being provided.

* Developers don't tell the computer anything at all. The machine does all the work.
* Example: teach a computer to determine features of circles or rectangles by showing it tons of examples until it can infer features of circles and rectangles.

### Artificial Intelligence

* Developers tell computers how to analyze information.
* Computers do not adapt or learn.

## Artificial Intelligence At Amazon

### Flywheel of Data

This is a repeating cycle:

* More data
  * Click stream, user activity, generated content, purchases, clicks, likes, sensor data
* Better Analytics
  * Object storage, databases, data warehouse, Streaming analytics, BI (Business Intelligence), Hadoop, [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)/Presto, [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
* Better Products
  * Artificial Intelligence
* More Users

### Retail

* Suggest new products.
* Pack, sort, and move boxes around more efficiently to save time and serve customers faster.
