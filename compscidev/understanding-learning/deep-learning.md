### Brief History

* The foundation for the current era.
* In 2986, the rediscovery of the backpropogation training algorithm leverages the chain rule of derivates helpes the algorithm learn from its mistakes.
* The internet helped advance algorithms.
* GPUs became more popular and deep learning became much easier.

### Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

* They are designed to act like human brains.
* They can handle anomolies.
* Uses many layers of non-linear processing units.

## [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)

* This is a way better [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) I found that explains how deep learning works.
* Layers of Networks
  * Input layer
  * Hidden layers
  * Output layers.
* The basic unit is a **node** or artifical neuron.

### Types of Neural Networks

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)

#### Feedforward Network

* Data moves from one input to output without working backwards.
* Doesn't form a cycle between neurons.

#### Recurrent Networks

* Became much more popular after 2007.
* Speech recognition programs, text to speech, handwriting.

### Industry Domains and Use Cases

* Text analysis: analyzing mood, feelings, etc.
* Time series & predictive analysis
* Sound Analysis (e.g. Automotive and engineering for fluid motion)
* Image analysis (Tagging and identifying people in pictures)

## Amazon API Services

### Amazon Lex

* Conversational engine
* Speech to text.
* Natural language understanding to understand the intent of the input.

### Amazon Polly

* Lifelike Speech

### Amazon Rekognition

* Search and compare faces
* Recognize people.

## Deep Learning AMI

* Supports existing deep learning frameworks at scale.
* It helps you get started quickly.

### Getting Started

* One-click deploy from the AWS Marketplace
* GPU for large-scale training
* CPUs for interences.
* Launch an AWS Learning Template.

## Amazon Linux

* It's a linux image provided by AWS for use on AMazon Elastic Compute Cloud.
* It makes AWS Integration easier.

## C-Span Case Study

They did amazing things with the ability to upload tons of faces!
