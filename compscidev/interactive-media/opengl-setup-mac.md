## Mac (XCODE)

First, launch xcode and make a command line tool.

### Installing & Checking Quartz

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently doesn't work, I'm throwing darts at solutions until it does or going back to Xcode.
{% endhint %}

After doing some `brew install`s from various services, I ended up with OpenGL sorta being installed through a free open gl. You'll use `pgrep XQuartz` to see if it's running, and if it returns nothing install `brew install XQuartz`.  Since mine returned nothing, I ran the command and think it's installed. Where?&#x20;

I found it in `/applications/utilities/XQuartz.app`. Not sure if I'll reference it here because I was expecting some cpp headers, but I'll cross my fingers & come back to that if it doesn't work.&#x20;
