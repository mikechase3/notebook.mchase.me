# Microelectronics
* Microelectronics are great starting points to building small circuits & incorporating sensors/actuators. 
* Stuff here is probably focused more on Arduino & small stuff, less so a RasPi because that's an x86 computer
  * Exception being microservices/servers for fun. 
  * If it's specific to another topic like deploying a web server, that'd be under full-stack or web app dev instead.

## Tools of the Trade
You can tinker online with a few resources. As of 2024 some popular ones are:
1. [Wowiki](https://wokwi.com)
2. [Fritzing](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app)

Then there's of course the actual hardware.
### Microcontrollers & Development Boards
1. [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/hardware)
2. [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/)
3. Adafruit CircuitPlayground (has integrated lights, speaker, sensors)
4. ESP32/ESP8266 (has bluetooth/wifi)
5. [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/)

### Shields
For each board, it helps to have:

1. **Connectivity/Networking**: Wifi/Bluetooth/Zigbee/LoRA
2. **Sensors**: um... see sensors for various stuff.
3. **Actuators**: displays, lights, the sky is the limit but it's what you can see.

### Integrated Development Boards
* PlatformIO: An open-source ecosystem for IoT and embedded development, compatible with VSCode.
* MPLAB X: For PIC microcontrollers by Microchip Technology.
* Xilinx Vivado: For FPGA development.

### Circuit Simulation Software:

* LTSpice: For simulating analog circuits.
* Proteus: For simulating both microcontroller-based and analog circuits.
* Fritzing: For designing and visualizing circuits, easy for beginners.

### PCB Design Tools:

* KiCad: A free software suite for electronic design automation (EDA).
* Eagle: A comprehensive PCB design software.
* Altium Designer: Professional PCB and electronic design automation software. 

### Measurement and Debugging Tools:

* Oscilloscopes: Essential for measuring electronic signals.
* Logic Analyzers: For capturing and analyzing digital signals.
* Function Generators: For generating various types of electrical waveforms.

### Related Tools
* **3D Printer**: to create enclosures & parts. Use software like SolidWorks/Fusion360.
* **CNC Machining & Laser Cutting**: precicely cut components.
* **Power Management**: solar panels, DC-DC converters, relays.
* **FPGA**: under electrical/hardware topics in CompSciDev category. 
* **AWS IoT, Azure IoT**: helps with cloud based applications. 
* **RTOS**: realtime os, FreeROTS, Zephyr. 



## Project Exploration
People generally learn best by doing projects (see Education/Cone of learning). Pick something & do it. Popular sites are:

1. BelenaHub. (Lots of user submitted projects)
2. Hackster.io
3. Instructables (plethora of DIY w/ other projects)
4. Adafruit Learn System
5. Arduino project Hub

## Sensor Exploration
See [sensors](/compscidev/microelectronics/sensors/sensors.md)

## Educational Resources for Kids
* TODO: include autonomous rover for full throttle stem.
