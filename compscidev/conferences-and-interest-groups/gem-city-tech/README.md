## Attributes of Clean Code

### No Magic Numbers

- All code shouldn't have any "numbers" that are just defined.&#x20;
- They should all be attached to a constant.
- Never just have `moveForward(10)`, but put that in as a constant.

### Meaningful Descriptive Identifiers

- For variables.

### Self-Documenting Code

- Functions should be clear.
- .

### DRY Code (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)

- Don't repeat yourself when possible.
- .

### Consistent Code Style

.

### Reduced Nesting

.

### Game Delays

- Developers here are saying "double however much time it'll take."
- Consider quadrupling your estimates while starting.
- Incrementally address forces that encourage change/growth. Allow opportunities for growth to be exploited locally as they occur.
- Refactor unrelentingly.

The site has explanations for:
- **BIG BALL OF MUD**
- **THROWAWAY CODE**
- **PIECEMEAL GROWTH**
- **KEEP IT WORKING**
- **SHEARING LAYERS**
- **SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG**
- **RECONSTRUCTION**
  - Used when you can't comprehend your code.
  - Throw it away & start over.


## Additional Concepts
- It's an **iterative project** like a scientific method. Hypothesize, try it, test it, revise your hypothesis.
- It's *inherently creative*.
- The most important testing in games is player testing.

## Big Ball of Mud & Architectures
[http://www.laputan.org/mud/](http://www.laputan.org/mud/)

Typical Software Architectures:
- **N-Tier Software Architecture**
- **MVC**: Model View Controller
- Essentially, every game might start off with structured diagrams but turns into a *big ball of mud* (unstructured).
  - Spaghetti code example graphic.
  - Shantytowns: common, inexpensive materials. Anyone who can code might create spaghetti code.
