# Data Visualization Libraries

## Process

1. Format/clean: pandas
2. Visualize: seaborn
3. Styling: enhances message to reach intended audience
   1. Framing: does the data visualization answer initial questions about the data or reveal more unanswered questions?
   2. Design: is the design clean & colors convey meaning? Is the font easy to read? Is it legible?
