* **Fair Use Disclosure**: I believe my notes help the overall market, is used for educational use, is for non-commercial reasons, and is somewhat transformational. I will use limited amounts of her content but be sure to checkout her class for a much better learning experience.

## My Resources

Ranked in order of usefulness:

1. Her recommended resources are better than the ones I put together for myself, so check that out on the sidebar <-
2. **Flashcards** (physical): a combination of her course & Swift Apprentice Ray Wenderlich.
3. Studies app or Quizlet? Might experiment with it because it'll allow for faster image composition.
