## Intro

Most of my knowledge comes from:

1. CPS 5?? AI Spring 2024 @ UD by Ju Shen
   * Contact: 229-2195; jshen1@ud; JH 118
   * TA: Namartha Thata
   * Book is AI: A Modern Approach by Russel/Norvig
   * Academic Papers from: AAAI & CVPR
2. Crash Course AI (With Hands-On Labs!)
3. 3Blue1Brown Videos
4. "Hands on machine learning scikit, kana?, Tensorflow"

## General Information

* **Programming** is static code while **AI** is generative, dynamic, and responds to new environments.
* Conceptualized in 1956, but hardware limitations & a lack of data sources hindered progress until 2012.

## Final exam

* Supervised learning; unsupervised learning; RL concepts.
  * A-Star Search:
    * Heuristic function
      * Admissable
      * Expansion
      * f()= g() + h()
* Unsupervised Learning & Markov Decision Process
  * What's stochastic. (Difference between MDP & A\*)
  * MDP Tree - what are the features. (Height, root)
  * State & Q-Trees.
    * Some represent edges? Some are about distribution?
  * "Tell me what's next" in the solutions:
    * Bellman is one solution
    * Policy Iteration is the other solution.
    * E.g. tell me what should be the next action in this case.
* Reinforcement Learning
  * Know the difference between MDP and reinforcement learning. Why introduce a new learning skill?
  * Model-based versus model-free approaches.
  * Monte-Carlo solution. How do we use Monte-Carlo to solve the states?
  * TD Temporal Difference TD solution.
    * Epsilon-Greedy $$\epsilon$$-greedy
    * SARSA
* Neural Networks & Deep Reinforcement Learning
  * Know concepts of layers, calculations in the forward pass.
  * Activation functions
    * Relu & sigmoid
  * Backwards Propagation
