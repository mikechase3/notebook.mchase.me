Told it to write a short storty about a college student in a rural midwest school that goes into the business of IT for tother students.
> In the quaint town of Willow Creek, nestled amidst the rolling hills of rural Midwest, resided a brilliant college student named Ethan James. Unlike his peers who pursued traditional majors, Ethan had a keen interest in technology.
> As a freshman at Willow Creek College, Ethan noticed a glaring need for reliable IT support among his fellow students. Many struggled with malfunctioning computers, slow internet connections, and virus attacks. Recognizing an opportunity, Ethan decided to venture into the business of IT.
> With a modest investment, Ethan set up a small office in his dorm room. Armed with his technical prowess and a willingness to help, he offered his services to students in need. Word spread quickly of Ethan's expertise and affordable rates, and soon his business began to thrive.
> Ethan's clients came from all walks of life. There were aspiring writers plagued by software crashes, engineers struggling with AutoCAD glitches, and gamers facing connectivity issues. Ethan approached each problem with patience, solving them with a combination of technical knowledge and ingenuity.
> As Ethan's business grew, so too did his reputation. Professors and university staff began seeking his assistance, further solidifying his credibility. Ethan's income allowed him to purchase better equipment and expand his services, offering remote support, virus removal, and custom software installations.
> In the end, Ethan's IT venture not only earned him a steady income but also provided an invaluable learning experience. He honed his technical skills, developed his entrepreneurial spirit, and made lasting connections within the college community. And as Willow Creek College students continued to grapple with their technological woes, Ethan's office served as a beacon of hope and a testament to the transformative power of innovation in a rural setting.




## Intro

Most of my knowledge comes from:

1. CPS 5?? AI Spring 2024 @ UD by Ju Shen

## Projects

TODO: put github/gitlab project links here...

## General Information

* **Programming** is static code while **AI** is generative, dynamic, and responds to new environments.
* Conceptualized in 1956, but hardware limitations & a lack of data sources hindered progress until 2012.

## Final exam

* Supervised learning; unsupervised learning; RL concepts.
  * A-Star Search:
    * Heuristic function
      * Admissable
      * Expansion
      * f()= g() + h()
* Unsupervised Learning & Markov Decision Process
  * What's stochastic. (Difference between MDP & A\*)
  * MDP Tree - what are the features. (Height, root)&#x20;
  * State & Q-Trees.&#x20;
    * Some represent edges? Some are about distribution?
  * "Tell me what's next" in the solutions:
    * Bellman is one solution
    * Policy Iteration is the other solution.
    * E.g. tell me what should be the next action in this case.
* Reinforcement Learning
  * Know the difference between MDP and reinforcement learning. Why introduce a new learning skill?
  * Model-based versus model-free approaches.&#x20;
  * Monte-Carlo solution. How do we use Monte-Carlo to solve the states?
  * TD Temporal Difference TD solution.
    * Epsilon-Greedy $$\epsilon$$-greedy
    * SARSA
* Neural Networks & Deep Reinforcement Learning
  * Know concepts of layers, calculations in the forward pass.&#x20;
  * Activation functions
    * Relu & sigmoid
  * Backwards Propagation
