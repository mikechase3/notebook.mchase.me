With High Temperature, k=5, p=1 Told it to write a short storty about a college student in a rural midwest school that goes into the business of IT for tother students.

> In the quaint town of Willow Creek, nestled amidst the rolling hills of rural Midwest, resided a brilliant college student named Ethan James. Unlike his peers who pursued traditional majors, Ethan had a keen interest in technology. As a freshman at Willow Creek College, Ethan noticed a glaring need for reliable IT support among his fellow students. Many struggled with malfunctioning computers, slow internet connections, and virus attacks. Recognizing an opportunity, Ethan decided to venture into the business of IT. With a modest investment, Ethan set up a small office in his dorm room. Armed with his technical prowess and a willingness to help, he offered his services to students in need. Word spread quickly of Ethan's expertise and affordable rates, and soon his business began to thrive. Ethan's clients came from all walks of life. There were aspiring writers plagued by software crashes, engineers struggling with AutoCAD glitches, and gamers facing connectivity issues. Ethan approached each problem with patience, solving them with a combination of technical knowledge and ingenuity. As Ethan's business grew, so too did his reputation. Professors and university staff began seeking his assistance, further solidifying his credibility. Ethan's income allowed him to purchase better equipment and expand his services, offering remote support, virus removal, and custom software installations. In the end, Ethan's IT venture not only earned him a steady income but also provided an invaluable learning experience. He honed his technical skills, developed his entrepreneurial spirit, and made lasting connections within the college community. And as Willow Creek College students continued to grapple with their technological woes, Ethan's office served as a beacon of hope and a testament to the transformative power of innovation in a rural setting.
